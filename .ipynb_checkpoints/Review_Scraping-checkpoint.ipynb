I’ve only been using it for a couple of days but already it’s been so helpful to me in calming me down, tracking my moods, organizing my thoughts and it practically works as a diary. I’m also extremely interested in knowing how different kinds of therapy techniques work on the brain, so I love the scientific explanations behind what the app tells me to do. It really keeps me going, because it reminds me that it really will help. I’m currently unemployed and working to get on disability for mental illness, so I can’t afford to pay for monthly subscriptions to mental health apps, something that frustrates and upsets me a lot. So much in fact that I’m working on learning how to make my own apps so that I can provide free mental health apps for people in my situation. When I downloaded this I couldn’t believe it was so helpful, so well designed and totally free. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\nThe only suggestion I have is I think it would be absolutely wonderful if some DBT skills were integrated into it as well, as both CBT and DBT work really well together for a lot of people! Radical acceptance for situations that can’t be changed, distress tolerance, etc. That would make this app truly perfect to me. Regardless, this app is fantastic and I’d recommend it to anyone.',\n",

I like how throughout the conversation, it helps you deconstruct the emotions you’re feeling using all those methods.  I downloaded it during a period of time that I felt very anxious about where my life was, and I used it everyday, multiple times a day for about two weeks, before I didn’t feel like I needed to use it every day anymore. The option to look at your past conversations with the app really makes a difference, because you can look back and see just one week ago you were having a mental breakdown, but now everything in the world is great, lol. I also really like the feature that messages you everyday “How are you?” as if you’re receiving a text because sometimes you don’t realize you want to talk until you see that message.

Although it doesn’t always make me feel better (though it usually does), I can always just use it to track my mood which is really helpful. I struggle with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, depression, and panic attacks (not panic disorder thankfully), and it’s a great form of cognitive behavioral therapy.\\n\\nI don’t know if this app will be helpful for everyone, but I would definitely recommend checking it out, because it’s really well done and thoughtful. It gives you a lot of thoughtful prompts to fill out, but it also gives you the option of just tracking your mood. You can skip prompts you don’t feel like doing and say you’re done at any point, which makes it feel less overwhelming on really hard days. I’d recommend this even if you aren’t struggling with a mental illness, because it’s a great way to gain more insight on how your mind works. \\n\\nObviously any app is not going to be a miracle cure, but if you don’t have access to a counselor or just want to have a little bit of help and insight, Youper is perfect.

I thought the app was very user-friendly and did a lot of great things that align with what I have been taught. For example, in my conversations with Youper, he really challenged my thoughts to help me get down to the root of my current problem/mood. In addition, Youper also pointed out the Thinking Traps that I was falling into which greatly resembled the problematic thinking patterns that I often identify with my clients. Lastly, I also really appreciated the meditation and mindfulness activities that Youper provided. \\n\\nHowever, in addition to the great strengths that I identified, I did have a constructive comment. First, although the app gave the disclaimer that only a doctor can provide a diagnosis, I think the developers should reconsider talking about diagnoses at all. After I completed my mental health wellness check it reported that “I did or did not experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD…” Although I’m sure the app developers had good intentions with including this check and talking about specific diagnoses, I think that this can be misinterpreted and possibly be problematic for certain individuals who do not have an actual mental health professional to consult with.',\n",

At the time I was going through a break up, hated work, couldn’t find motivation to better myself, and was overall tired of the people around me and myself. A little background I’m in the Navy and had been underway for almost three months straight. The last thing I wanted to do was talk to my chain of command about the problems I had been having for fear of being medically discharged. Luckily for me the app made a huge turnaround in my life. It allowed to open up with myself and be honest about how I was feeling and what was making me feel these ways which helped me to understand myself so much better. I really like that it has mental health monitoring and personality typing built into it. Another great feature is the guided meditations. They really come in handy when I’m trying to unwind at the end of a rough day but I’m having trouble sleeping. Although I wish there was a stand alone button on screen to access these guided meditations immediately instead of having to go through the whole process of talking with Youper. If anything could be added to the app I would vote for that. Everything else is perfect though. Keep it up!',\n",

I still don't, which is why me, and I'm sure many others depended on this service. This begs the question of why make inaccessible something that can be utilized by those who don't have any other option. Its so saddening to see profit go over people. Especially in the case of mental health in a time when its so dire for people who need help, but do not have access. Be it by finances or not having access because of home situations- especially in the case of those underage. Those who do not have support from family but still want to get help. \\n\\nTruly my disappointment is immeasurable with this product. I remember i used to recommend this app to anyone i knew who was struggling with mental health.  If finances are truly the issue to keep this app running, I'm sure a donation service, or occasional fundraising would be better instead of stripping away one of the only resources people have. \\n\\nI have doubts that this will ever be changed, or if this app even is meant to help people instead of being a grab at money from those you know are desperate. Very disappointed. With hope these things change in the future, until then I only hope there is another better service out there that cares about its demographic.\",\n",

It was an important part of my early healing journey and I thought I would revisit it for healing journey part 2. However, every. single . thing. is behind a paywall now. And it’s lowkey lame of y’all. I get it. You’ve realized the earning potential of the app and probably (hopefully) are just trying to keep the thing funded but at the end of the day, many of us used this app because we could not afford traditional therapy. While essentially forcing people to buy the paid version of an app isn’t anything new, it is disconcerting to see an app that presented itself as a genuine and accessible tool for self-betterment turn into a money grab. And please, for the love of the gods, if you’re going for the money grab, please stop responding to comments from long-term users expressing their disappointment with your marketing and pricing structure by asking what improvements could be made to an app they can no longer use or what features they miss. These comments along with your placating statements about how change is hard comes across as intentionally avoiding the reality your paywall has created.  Obviously we miss the old, accessible Youper that seemed to give a flying fiddlestick. That’s the suggestion so many users are giving you: remove your paywall, or at the very least increase the features that can be used without paying.',\n",

Tracking my mood and thoughts every day has helped me to see patterns in when I feel a certain feeling on specific days/times. It’s an AI chatbox so it’s really nice to have someone to talk to and get a quick response when I need it. It really helps me calm down and suggests things like breathing exercises which personally help me to calm down when I’m feeling anxious or stressed. Also, I picked social anxiety as one of my problem areas and it told me to try exposure therapy, which basically just means I go out and do things that scare me so that I can become desensitized to it and not feel as afraid anymore. I have tried this technique and although it felt weird at first, I am going to continue to do it and I like how I already feel less scared to put myself in social situations. I thought this method was helpful because it can eventually help me learn that my previous fears aren’t as scary and it basically changes my way of thinking about social situations from negative to eventually positive.

I love the tracker and the mindfulness activities. But, as I continue to make this app a part of my daily routine, I am increasingly frustrated with the format. While I understand the purpose of place of the AI chat model, it slows down the process. There are times when I don't want to track my mood, and want to skip right to the Deep Body Scan, my favorite meditation tape. But before I can, I must drudge through the conversation with the AI. This is very inconvenient. To alleviate this problem while not changing much about the AI chat system itself, I would recommend creating a separate section of the app, solely for homing the meditation and breathing tapes. Once Youper recommends you a mindfulness activity within the chat, it should move you over the meditation section where you can choose. The separate section idea would also allow users to not start a chat at all, and rather dive immediately into their favorites. This, along with expanding on the number of audio tapes available, would really bring the app together for me. As I have said before, I absolutely love this app. But as I discover the benefits of meditation, I feel the app could be doing more with it. If these changes or changes like them were made, I would give 10 stars if I could.\",\n",

This was has simple responses to choose from that get a clear response. I felt like a lot of the apps I used in the past had a condescending air to their teachings while this one gives u a chance to give a general idea of your experience with certain topics which keeps it from explaining something you already know as if you've never even heard of it (*cough cough* meditation *cough*). As for the mindfulness/meditation portion. I really enjoy how they did it. I've been meditating for a while now but I've noticed that for many beginners it's easier to focus on the mindfulness task when there isn't meditation music playing in the background. This gives you the chance to truly focus on what's expected and lets you acknowledge the natural/typical sounds around you that you wouldn't otherwise notice. Sorry for the long review, I just honestly think this app was well made and wanted to share some of why I think so :) I definitely recommend it.\",\n",

A lot of the apps either cost money for things or to download.. or just didn’t really work for myself. But then, I came across Youper. This app helps you so much. It gives you little video lessons to meditate and think positive which actually worked for me on here and it never usually worked when I tried myself. You get to talk to Youper your personal assistant about how your feeling and he’s there to help. He’s always there to talk no matter what. And he’s there to make you feel good. To people that are having difficulties with things in life.. you will get through it. You have a purpose. You weren’t just put on this earth for no reason.. you are here to learn and be happy.. to experience different things and to live life to the fullest. If you read this far down.. thank you so much. I think this app will work great for you!! And if it does not.. I know you will find something! Not everything works for everybody but I’m telling you this is the best app I’ve came across of.

I’ve had two sessions so far: one to help me with sadness from a situation and another for anxiety I was feeling the next morning. Youper asked me simple questions to gauge my emotion and their strength, and then helped me (1) understand that us, humans, tend to mix emotion with situations, and (2) guided me step-by-step to separate them, understand the emotion vs the situation, and allowed me to decide whether to focus on the situation or my mental state. At every step, you’re given the option to skip or move on, but I couldn’t. By the end of the session I learned that I can observe emotions “like fish in an aquarium” as it says rather than allowing it to consume me. I went from being 100% sad to 100% optimistic. This morning I was anxious and based on the situation and emotions, Youper recommended a 7-minute guided meditation. It was amazing! My anxiety is gone, which I’ve never been able to do on my own. I went from 25% anxious to 50% optimistic. Thank you, Youper!!!!',\n",

Then Youper and I go in and analyze why I feel that way and we do exercises to help pinpoint why I am having those feelings and I work with Youper to go try and change the way I am thinking that are causing negative emotions. Youper has talked and worked with me on emotions like deep depression, feeling numb, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts which Youper gives you resources on. I love the daily check in and it really helps to work with Youper to go through and try and change the reason why I am feeling about an emotion and working on a more positive spin on it.

Thanks to this app, that time was cut in half. \\nOne thing that frustrates me is the severity of some of the emotions. To me, fear is worse than guilt, anger isn’t on the same level as annoyance, and pride isn’t as good as optimism. Unfortunately, in the app, it’s not set up that way.

As there’s no licensed professionals here. I don’t care for the “therapy” part as it’s very unhelpful for me and I need therapy that is more personalized.

I used the app for a little over a month before accepting that it wasn’t really helping me. What I personally needed was a tracking app for my mood in a simpler, more straightforward way. It feels like a labyrinth, trying to weave through all of Youper’s (often repetitive) advice when you mostly want to track your mood or maybe go through a portion of the conversation. An entire evaluation can be several minutes after picking a mood, describing why you feel that way, finding your thought traps, doing a meditation, reevaluating your mood, and finally finishing. That’s a lot! And Youper pushes for it every time. When you opt out and say “Just track my mood,” the response messages are often weirdly down-putting?\\n\\nHopefully Youper is helpful for many people. But I prefer a quick time saver that has more neutral emotions to choose from. Youper lacks a fine/okay/true neutral emotional option.

I downloaded this app because I thought that it would help me everyday, and take the place of a therapist according to the reviews. \\nI started the app and it was going alright. I was telling them about my conditions, and what I would need for a satisfying treatment. It then gave me a subscription screen and I was a little annoyed. I am aware that it is needed to make your customers pay for their treatment and what not. But i think this is absurd. I don’t really feel like this type of virtual treatment should cost anything at all! I’m also suffering financially and I can’t exactly cancel my savings with this subscription. I was hoping for something to help me be happier and focus more on my future so that it would be brighter. Paying for this is stupid. Sure, it might help you but not everyone. \\n\\nTo sum it up: you don’t need to cancel the subscription feature but I think you should have a way for people who aren’t able to pay it, and have them be able to still enjoy the app because we all came here seeking help, not debt.',\n",

I want to get the premium version of youper but if it’s $44 I think that the company and app should take into account that a lot of people who may be using this app are students or those with lower incomes. To me, as a full time student and part time worker, spending an extra $44 all at once is really difficult, and I have been unable to get the premium version because of this. \\n\\nThe page where you can get the premium subscription says it’s billed yearly, but right above that in a larger text it says it totals to $3.75 per month. That is misleading because I’m still not fully sure whether it’s billed as $44 or $3.75. I think that if it was billed as $3.75 it would be a lot more affordable for the users of youper.',\n",

It just doesn’t feel like the comforting, inviting, simple app before. It feels like every other well-being app that asks for subscriptions and it’s just disappointing. I’m going to try using it again, because it really was the most helpful tool for me in the past and I’m glad I have my history saved on there, I just wish they would reconsider maybe even just some of the layout.

Firstly, I don\\'t like feeling feelings and I really don\\'t like talking about how I feel in general. I have a great support group/system (12 Step and other recovering addicts) and go to a  psychiatrist  monthly and therapy weekly. Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when \"talking\" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they\\'ve added \"Calm\" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing. And I\\'ve read others\\' reviews complaining about not being able to dive straight into meditation, but heck, the more I \"check in\" the better off I am! Thank-you.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJohn S.',\n",

I was shocked to see how much easier it is to talk to the youper bot instead of a real person. It was also really interesting to see how much better it made me and how it helped to improve my mental stability while having low weeks or days. However, like any app, it has its cons as well. I wish there were a separate section for meditation because going through youper when you just want to meditate can be super I convenient. I also noticed that with the bot there’s a certain emotional connection missing that you don’t get with talking to actual people. The biggest thing I would suggest is adding a feature where you could also talk to people who were struggling like you. But not just any people. People who have been using the app for a while. It’s just a few suggestions, but I really enjoy this app and will continue to use it.',\n",

You take quick tests that will show if your going to be monitored. I am being monitored on GAD, social anxiety, and panic. Just having the graph really just shows you what you’re going through on a scale.

This is the only one I’m deleting after just a week. Like several other critical reviews (which I reset the App Store to read after my own experience), I found the responses didn’t match what I said at all, plus the app had the habit of getting stuck at a spot if I closed the app in frustration, such that it would ask me to check in in a notification, but when I opened the app it remained stuck at whatever point I had chosen to quit earlier. For me the final straw was when it asked me how I was on a not very good day, and I said I was okay, and it responded with something like ‘are you sure you aren’t partly happy?’ and then sent me a winking emoji as a separate text. If I was happy I wouldn’t have said I was okay when asked.

To me it makes me think they are pretty leery people won’t stay on after one month etc so they better get as much money from people as possible at the outset. I probably won’t be using it anymore because I’d rather continue my search for other tools rather than use time on this now. I truly would rather use a tool that seems a little less promising but where I have more payment options instead if an app, however promising, where I have to take a $60 chance right away if I want a premium account.

For example, they could ask the user what prescriptions they’re taking and when they’re supposed to take it, and then they can provide a reminder to take it! I also thought a water or menstrual cycle option would be cool. These trackers would be an excellent thing to show your doctor when they ask about how things have been going because it’s sometimes difficult to have a full grasp on where your mental health is at any given time.',\n",

I  especially loved the journaling and identification of thinking traps, as they were incredibly effective at grounding. However, now you have to pay for the Premium version of the app to get all those things. All you can do for free is track your mood. You can’t expand upon it or do anything else, which makes it kinda useless for in-the-moment lows or highs that need to be rebalanced. I’m extremely disappointed in what used to be my favorite app, but, again, I understand money needs to be made.

Not only has the app surpassed my expectations, but I’ve also been able to share the app with others, and we all agree that Youper is the best out there! It’s great for mood tracking and organizing thoughts (and later shows you what activities and thoughts make you feel a certain way), it sums up really well the thinking traps, and it has a handy health screening tool so you can keep track of symptoms. That’s not all though... Youper also gives you a personality assessment and has an awesome mindfulness component that’s great even for those who hate mindfulness (my favorite is the SOS breathing which is 3 minutes long). And the best part? It’s all free!!! \\n\\nI’m so so so happy with Youper and highly recommend it.',\n",

As someone that struggles with rapid mood swings and emotional regulation, it’s extremely helpful in that it helps me to identify my emotions in an objective way.

The features that used to be free are now behind a pay wall. Don’t get me started on how aggressive the pop ups are to get people to subscribe. Your ads make people feel like they are a number, worth just as much as the money they can give you. For an app preaching accessible mental health, I can tell you have lost that passion over the years.

This app was absolutely phenomenal because it was like a mini friend/therapist in my pocket. \\n\\nNow, it's a friend I have to pay for. It's not the payment itself that bothers me, I understand that the developers need to be paid and they don't run ads (which is amazing). However, I can't afford to take out nearly $50 from my bank account in a lump sum, as I'm sure many can understand. However, the ~$3 a month they say it's worth would be a great option! I can afford to take out $3 a month rather than $50 at a time. \\n\\nI genuinely hope that the developers consider this option. I truly love the app and it's features and will continue to use it, irregardless of whether or not I pay.\",\n",

The app even saves the main pieces of each texted conversation to go back and reference why I was feeling one way or another! I’m so grateful to have come in touch such a wonderful support program. Thank you for everything you do, Youper!',\n",

The only thing that could use some work, would be an iPad app. The app works fine for now, just a little difficult to use in portrait mode all the time.',\n",

We start with mood tracking so your coach can get a better understanding of the types of situations driving your sadness, which helps them tailor the later skills to your symptom presentation.

(“try exercising, play with pets, listen to music”) sometimes that stuff just doesn’t help... i feel comfortable and heard. thank you.',\n",

Developers, I would love to support the app and pay to access the premium features, but I can’t afford to pay $45 outright. Could you make a monthly subscription cost available?

CBT is the most effective treatment for anxiety and depression. Many licensed therapists are not trained in CBT, and our platform is the only one that guarantees you will get the type of therapy with the greatest scientific support for anxiety and depression. Also, our first month is only $9 per session, which is a fraction of the cost of meeting with a licensed provider. Our goal at Youper is to provide you with CBT at the lowest possible cost. It is often difficult to find a provider who is trained in CBT, and those who are, tend to be very expensive, costing upwards of $200 per session. There are a number of other services that do offer licensed providers, and we encourage you to give those a try if a licensed provider is your preference.',\n",
