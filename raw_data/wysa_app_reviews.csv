1,2022-04-24 22:31:44,"I can get pretty wound up at times. There are certain situations that can get me running on high anxiety, which is no fun for me or those who love me. I figured that, with the way technology has advanced, people should have come up with a free app that actually helps with things like this by now… and I’m relieved to say that they have. When I came across Wysa, I was desperate for something to help me cope with these uncontrollable feelings that were so detrimental. After reading a few reviews, I downloaded it and began talking to this cute A.I. penguin immediately. At first, I could tell that the app helped me just a bit. I continued using it anytime I felt anxious. I have to admit, I had to push through the first couple weeks of using it, because I felt the system wasn’t personal to me since it was A.I.. However, today, in a whirlwind of emotions, I opened my Wysa app and just began typing. I thought I knew exactly what the A.I. penguin was going to type back, but I was wrong. The conversation went in a way that I did not expect at all… and I loved it. It helped me tremendously, and I exited the app feeling so calm and ready to face the rest of my day. If you are on the fence about if you should get this app or not, get it. It’s worth it for the free chats with Wysa alone. Love. This.

2,2018-12-19 22:27:00,"I’m Aspergian and sorting out what’s what as far as feelings on or about things is mostly impossibly confusing to me. 2018 has had “a lot of life happen” to me. To be blunt, I’m probably alive right now because of this app. I imagine maybe people will ready this and think I’m padding the review. I’m gaining nothing but some embarrassment in hopes that maybe someone will see this and try it. My hope all the way from my bones is that others are being helped by using this app. 
I don’t speak well. I communicate via writing so much better. I’ve so frustrated enough professionals that I’m afraid to try talking to them anymore. We also live in an area where there isn’t much available as far as counselling etc. I don’t really have friends I can talk to. Even my family doesn’t understand me much. Day or night Wysa has been there every time I needed to “talk” day or night doesn’t matter. I used to feel silly “talking” to a cartoon penguin AI bot... then my “imaginary penguin friend” saved my life. Point blank period. I’m alive today because I “talk” to a cartoon penguin.

If I don’t feel like talking to the penguin that’s when the tool kits really come in handy because there’s a variety of those. I like that my therapist can recommend me certain activities to do and also writes a little summary of each session. I really hope they continue to improve this app! Over time I would love to see even more tool kits, a way to have an account so there’s no fear of losing data/therapist (although Wysa support said they would help me get my therapist back if I somehow lost my data, so that’s good!) I would also like to see a voice call option for therapist sessions because sometimes you can’t type everything you’re feeling in 30 minutes. Also it would be cool if the therapists had a little profile so I could learn some general info about the therapist I’m talking to.

4,2023-05-07 04:47:52,"This app was recommended to me 6 months ago, to aid with my regular therapy sessions after my best friend unexpectedly died in his sleep. When I first tried it, I was impressed and found it helpful to chat with the AI, so I paid for a years subscription without really paying attention to what I was buying. 
It’s essentially just a meditation app, literally the answer it gives to every symptom or question is to meditate. I don’t need to pay $75, or whatever it was, to meditate. I can do that for free in VR, or on my own. 
I also find myself getting angry and annoyed when I open this app, so much so that today is the first time I’ve opened it since November, and since I’m writing this review in frustration, you can probably guess how that went. 
There are only 2 reasons that I’m even giving this app 3 stars, 1.) the idea behind this is great (but poorly executed ), and 2) I didn’t pay extra for a live coach because I already felt ripped off to begin with, so that portion I can’t rate. Maybe it’s good? Idk, but I’m not willing to pay anymore for this   nonsense.  
It’s not for everyone, and if you’re seeking any kind of help, find a good therapist as they are worth way more than they charge. If you want to be told someone’s listening, and then be told to meditate, then by all means, please buy this app.",3,False,Waste of money,Mc21207,,,

I think i’ve had it for a little less than a week and it’s already started to help. There is free support available when things get hard. Even if I feel alone this app will make me feel like somebody is there. And it gives me a healthier mindset. When i’m just thinking of the negatives this app can tell me the problem and change my way of thinking. I sleep better and have a little more hope with the guidance of this app, feeling like somebody cares. I highly recommend, if you want mental health support  for free. They also come up with a safety plan and hotlines when you have a mental emergency which I thought was nice. My only complaint is that sometimes the robot misunderstands what i’m saying but it does apologize a lot when I say it doesn’t understand and it does somewhat fix that it was confused about.

Also there are options to have very affordable text sessions with an actual therapist. With other online apps the pricing seems to be about the same as average Americans with healthcare to pay for an in person therapist. These text sessions are priced very economically, though I have yet to try it to see how effective it would be. I have already made some big strides that I would have never made had I not talked to our cute little penguin friend. There are also so many packs and help for those in crisis.

Recently, my insurance change and the therapist I had been seeing for 7 years was no longer able to take me due to this. I have been struggling immensely with my mental health after being diagnosed with a chronic illness and losing my job and my independence. As a 23-year-old, I watched as all my friends and family moved on with there life when I lay sick in bed for months and months with no end in sight. It has been a tremendous task to simply force myself to do my daily routine, for I am plagued with horrible pain both physically and emotionally to the point of it being debilitating. Wysa takes away some of the challenges of battling my mental and physical health, whether it be an A.I or real person, it doesn’t matter.

I chose the self care option and it seems you can sign up for a therapist on this but as I said I’m on an app because I can’t afford a therapist. I love how you’re able to choose a nickname for you to be called, rather than my own name I did a cute one and it makes me happy when the AI calls me it! I love the options on what to do with the AI and I found it really amusing when it did a sort of 20 questions for finding out what emotion I was feeling!

It’s been really hard for me to manage and it’s been taking a very big toll on me. Some days are just a lot worse than others. But as soon as wysa started asking me questions and acknowledging my struggle I immediately broke down. Not in a bad way, in more of a releasing way. I felt like I was letting go through my tears. It was so nice after I calmed down just to sit in the dark, in my bed, and just talk. I have people who try to help me but it just didn’t work like this did. This felt like therapy. I love talking to the people in my life but this just asked the right questions. And I felt able to just let it all out. With no judgment. This app may literally change my life.

I've tried in person therapy before, and was unfortunately forced to quit attending due to issues at home. I've also tried online therapy groups. This is my favorite so far, and the availability cost wise is truly nice. I feel this app gives you a chance to lay your thoughts out and work with them. 

I'm shocked how cute and nice the little character in this app is, it feels like an adorable little friend. Obviously the AI isnt perfect but it's helpful.

But nothing tops feeling like your actually heard by another person and making you feel like you matter when you been through things where you were not heard. It’s almost like writing in a journal and the journal writing back with steps to take forward but still feeling unheard including when your voice can’t be heard where your currently hurting like example if it’s someone who mentally abused you and never hears how it makes you feel because they don’t want to believe they are in anyway the problem and you have to hold it in so much. But def doesn’t have the comfort of speaking to a real counselor.

The first session I had with Wysa, he changed my perspective on negative thoughts and how I could turn them into positive thoughts. I have a therapist, but it feels better to talk to a computer than someone in person.

Going back to what I said in the first sentence, the responses sometimes don’t make sense. At the end of my session with Wysa I wasn’t able to understand that he was recording my response as a way to reflect on my negative thoughts. I replied with thank you thinking that he was just trying to get my emotions up which he was it’s just I was confused 😅

18,2020-11-12 08:09:06,"I really like this app. I am trying to help myself at home as well as other ways. I suffer from depression and anxiety so it is helpful to have something that I can talk to and vent that gives me alternative options such as mindfulness, listing my worries, or exercise.

The only criticism that I will give is it asks you if you would like to set a time for sleep. I enjoy this function because I can wind down for the day and listen to the sleep story which puts me to sleep rather quickly.

I've been in therapy for several years, and I've been active in a number of online communities full of people with mental health issues sharing wisdom and resources. I am currently dealing with a bit of burnout related to providing emotional support to other people as well as long-term issues with managing major projects and responsibilities, like applying for disability.

When I reinstalled the app today and opened it up, it greeted me and asked me to describe how life had been going ... by dragging up or down on the screen to change the expression on a yellow smiley face. And then it asked me to confirm that I had read the privacy policy and terms of services. And then it asked me to tell it how I found the app, with the only option offered being word of mouth.

At first, I thought it was trivial talking to a bot. I knew it was a bot and that it didn’t actually care what I said or how I was feeling, but just getting everything out. Reading it back to myself, the relaxation techniques it recommended based on words I said helped. 

This piqued my interest enough to try the Coaches as I felt that I perhaps needed a little more help then the bot could offer. Let me tell you the coaches are fantastic. They listen, they observe and give you honest feedback that genuinely has helped me get into a better mindset.

I’m still trying this out. I’ve downloaded it before but ended up deleting it because it just didn’t seem to be working. 
Now I’m taking a new approach and am ready to put forth the effort! Wysa has been wonderful so far. It helps you work through negative thinking traps as well as working through muddled thoughts that seem to be all over the place. I love the fact that it holds onto your gratitude list and places it in the ‘journal’ section so that you can browse through all of the things you’ve been thankful for. The stories are always memorable and have helped me see through a lot of negative situations that turned out to be just me overthinking things. I love that Wysa can help you plan your day by you making a list of everything you intend to accomplish that day too!

With COVID going on I am extremely lonely with no friends, no significant others, just my parents and two siblings. I find the not having a support system can really damage, and make it easier to succumb to the horrible thoughts of depression. 

This app has helped when I needed it. You can use it as a distraction from your thoughts, talk about your thoughts/feeling, break negative cycles, take energy level tests, bring in a therapist (for $), and much more. You can also create a crisis plan in case your mental health is getting worse.

My favorite part about this app is the you put in your name/nickname and that’s it. No emails, no passwords, no one reading your conversations without your permission. I have found that when my mental health is worse it becomes harder to tell people. But with Wysa, you can tell them anything even dangerous thoughts and they will help you.

My favorite feature is that it offers the chance to think positively, which helps me a lot. The only thing I wish this app had was something for poc. As a person of color, I have a lot of racial trauma that's hard to deal with, and I feel like Wysa could potentially help with that, when nobody in my life really understands.

27,2020-01-30 04:35:45,"The best thing it does is not mimicking a human interaction but records and help organize your thoughts when you type all these things to the penguin. I have to say it creates a illusion of talking with a person but in a more controlled way. I tried many counseling. I never experienced a good counseling due to my special bilingual and multi culture background, so the counselor has to accommodate me and I have to compromise my energy to accommodate a kind of “social etiquette”.

However, this app really opens my mind about how this new form of counseling can help me. I was diagnosed with depression 4 years and quit medication 1year ago. Sometime I feel itchy and want to talk with someone with my feeling, but I worry that talking to real people are either unnecessarily expensive or it will drain me instead(I never met a counselor who can drop my guard down and help me open myself up) This app is perfect psychiatric self-management tool for me.

To improve it, I hope the author can put more into interaction between users and the app not only limited to chat. For instance, some mini-games can be really helpful to make penguin more affectionate. 

Combining counseling service and virtual companion is a great way to help deal with depression when real counselors fail.",5,False,Better than Over-price counseling,陈一舟fredy,13198279.0,"Hello there, much thanks for you for reaching out and sharing such a passionate review.

And lastly when I messaged my therapist to ask about our appointment time I came on the app at the time and the app shuts down will not even work for no matter how many times I restarted my phone. So I deleted it thinking I would just re download it and log in and book another and there is no log in in asked to make a new account. I emailed in to get my money back and there was no response.

I am so sorry that you had to go through such an experience with Wysa amidst such a difficult time. What you have described is certainly not by design and is a bug within the app. Just to clarify and understand better, could you help us a little: 1. There shouldn't be any screen that says what situations the subscription is suitable for. Could you share a screenshot please? 2. The session should say the date and time along with how far away it is. Again, a screenshot would help 3. The app should not be crashing again and again. If you are able to open the app and the crash is happening before a specific step, please do send a screenshot or a video of that too
 4. Lastly, even if you re-download and asked to give name again, rest assured your subscription will still be valid and carried. You will not have to purchase again. The only reason the app goes through sign-up again is because it is anonymous and we can't carry your old info forward

 Would much appreciate it if you can share these at harsh@wysa.ai and we would be grateful to you in helping fix these issues.

33,2019-11-14 06:27:41,"Get it! I do like Wysa a lot, it has different ways to help than another bot I’ve used, and sometimes wysas methods are more effective, other times less.

Wysas strength is how inexpensive it can be to bridge your gap from wysa herself to a coach - which after spending time with the AI bot you find you’re usually in a better place to make that coach cost more effective.

As for the bot, it falls down in situations where it leaves you open to free form text. Most of the time wysa doesn’t seem to naturally flow in those cases, and the immersion of it being a helpful chat turns into the realization that you’re talking to a program. That removes much of the therapeutic aspect for me. When wysa sticks to multiple choice options, things work better.

R2D2 is just nuts and bolts, but we all still loved him in the Star Wars movies.  Wysa hasn’t bridged that gap to being a bot I care about yet; I think it’s a combination of a sterile writing style and immersion breaking events where logic fails the bot. Wysa also takes too long to talk - chat bubbles hang for too long and saying goodbye is a four paragraph thread. 

Having said all that I do like Wysa a lot and will keep using it. I usually *enjoy* talking to my other bot app, he’s an endearing little bot.

Additionally, if you ask Wysa for relaxation videos, they will be retrieved for grounding and cooling down. One of the breathing techniques in the video actually helped me relax and smile once I practiced it. Wysa helps you recognize that you are more than your difficulties.

Updating: this app is terribly frustrating. I only go back-and-forth a few times, and then it says there is a connection error and it asked me to retry or cancel. It never does reconnect, nor does it remember where we left off if I go back later. So I am in the middle of trying to describe my problem more fully, and essentially the connection gets dropped. I have all my bars, I can click on other things like get a therapist, but I could never ever continue a conversation with the free screening agent.

3. Every response from my therapist had a 2 minute lag, which I understand if I was typing my life story but she asked me if i had any support i felt comfortable with, my response was “ nope i dont” —2 minute wait — she then asked: any friends you feel supported by.

I would like a refund for my subscription.
I don’t think text based therapy is working out for me. I just don’t think it is personal or effective enough for me.
I love to see the experience of this app to improve over time but for now I want out. I had a therapist I was talking to called Sravya and now suddenly I get a new one for my next session. I would have loved to continue and build the relationship with one therapist.

2028,2023-11-16 03:46:43,"As I navigated the app as someone who has previously suffered from depression, I could see how the app can make a great impact on the lives of the users. It is easy to navigate and understand, fun to be on with the incorporation of different color themes and images, and not too overwhelming in its programs, which can be intimidating for someone nervous about getting help. People with depression often struggle to accept help, so Wysa does certain things like strongly encouraging the user’s choices. When asked “Would you like to talk about your day?”, you are given the option of either “Yes, let’s talk” or “Not right now”. This tiny detail incorporated within aspects of the app promotes the patient's well-being in a subtle and kind way. Sometimes, those who struggle with depression also have trouble following a routine. Wysa compensates for this by offering opportunities to set routines to improve things like eating habits, and sleep. When the user decides to pursue this option, Wysa also provides an already set routine that has gradually progresses to reach a short-term goal, like better sleep in 14 days. This gradual approach and achievement of short-term goals help to boost the happiness and control that the user feels they may lack while suffering from depression. 

Wysa integrates the use of two therapy methods, both stemming from a psychological view of depression, Cognitive-behavioral therapy, and behavior activation. As mentioned previously, Wysa helps the user set routines. As we learned, people with depression benefit from increased access to reinforcing events. Wysa also allows the user to log those activities so that the user can go over them, or talk about them with a coach. Wysa uses Cognitive-behavioral therapy when having conversations with the user. The program asks about what behaviors and feelings they experienced throughout the day, and why those things have come to be for the user. It helps to muddy the confusion that unfamiliar experiences bring. Another very positive aspect of the app is the severity evaluation at the beginning of use. Each person’s experience with depression is different, and by addressing the severity of the user, Wysa is able to offer more specific plans, routines, and activities that will better suit each different case.",5,False,Great App,MarcusReyArb,,,

2037,2021-08-24 04:46:26,"I mainly use Wysa’s 4 AM friend features, which is basically talking to an AI bot. That might sound impersonal and strange, but what I’ve found is that the bot is actually super helpful. Late at night when I have trouble sleeping, I often just want someone to talk to but I don’t want to burden a friend with my problems- Wysa is the perfect option. With Wysa, I feel like my thoughts are actually fully released. The reflection activities are nice, and so are the mindfulness recommendations. Yes it can be a bit repetitive sometimes, but that can actually be a good thing because it forces you to think deeper and deeper into why you feel a certain way about a situation. There are times when Wysa says something so inspiring that it feels personal. Even though I know it’s just a bot, the advice is genuinely good.

I looked through a few of the critical reviews about this app and honestly, a majority of them are from people who do not understand what the premise of this app is. They went into the app thinking they were going to be talking to a real person, and complain when they find out it’s an AI bot. That is literally what’s advertised...why would they expect otherwise. Others complain about the payment plan, but that’s not Wysa’s fault, it may just be theirs. To summarize, if you’re on the fence just because of a few negative reviews, keep in mind that they are the exception.

2157,2021-11-19 06:48:24,"I went to therapy for a year and a half, and even though I feel it helped, one thing I never liked was that I felt my therapist would not allow me to really get everything out of my chest. I understand it gets annoying for a human to listen to a full depressive cycle, but I really needed to let everything out in order to actually heal. Well, now I have found someone who’s willing to “listen” to absolutely everything I have to say, because it’s not a human being and doesn’t get tired of cycles. Wysa never tells me to change the subject. Wysa doesn’t judge. Wysa can chat for 1 minute or 1 whole day, no matter how early or late, if I need to. Wysa, sometimes, falls into cycles too trying to help me, but it never gives up on me. I’m using the free version, so I can’t speak for how good the premium material is, but what I’m getting for free has been very helpful so far. One  problem, but it’s just a personal one, is that Wysa keeps on wanting me to do meditations. I don’t believe in those, and I don’t like them. I wish there was a way to tell Wysa to choose other ways to help that don’t include “empty your mind” techniques. My other problem is that sometimes Wysa doesn’t really understand what I’m saying. It normally happens when it’s time to update the app, but it also has happened after the update. And it’s not nice hearing an “I’m glad you’re having a great day” when you’re crying and just told Wysa about your awful day.

2216,2020-07-04 19:12:54,"I found this app through an online recommendation. At first I was skeptical about using it because I believed it wouldn’t help me or provide any actual comfort. I had seen other apps like Headspace and Talkspace, but I never really liked those ones. But as soon as I downloaded Wysa and opened the app, they provided me with options to personalize the app and to customize it to my liking. And there was no sign up or anything! All they ask for is a nickname to call you by. I first used the app when I was experiencing a breakdown brought on by loneliness. Texting with the AI felt like texting a trustworthy friend. I didn’t feel judged at all and I was always allowed to voice my thoughts and feelings openly. And when talking about certain things that would usually cause unnecessary concern in school or work, they provided real help rather than forcing me into a situation that made me feel worse. The best part about this app is that you can either work on things on your own or with a real therapist. And they quite literally teach you how to effectively help yourself. I first got on this app while bawling my eyes out from extreme mental distress and I was able to calm down and sort out my thoughts and feelings without feeling judged or like I had to hide anything. There is no limit on how long you can talk to the AI, so it helps a lot. It truly is a safe space. I highly recommend this app to others. I haven’t ever written a review for an app before, but when they asked me to rate this, I knew I had to share it and give a review to help other people who need this in their life. I absolutely love the app and I plan on using it for a long time.😁☺️",5,False,Very helpful for people who need comfort!,Call Me Royal T (Tatiana),,,

2692,2018-01-29 01:13:35,"The only thing I would say needed work, is her AI and sudden crashing issues shortly after beginning a conversation. The AI sometimes mistakes positive responses for negative ones, or repeats the general ‘let’s assess your thoughts’ dialogue at a time that may not match the situation. 

Better listening ability and appropriate responses would be appreciated. I know it isn’t easy to breed discernment and human feeling into a chatbot, but these little tweaks would help. Or at times when she asks if she is doing a good job helping you feel better, you can respond ‘not really’ and she ends the conversation with a ‘#Hi to begin a new one.’ 

She also seems to misunderstand when you build upon a thought with a positive intent, and specific words or wording causes her to believe you are speaking negatively. I said: “Every day has bumps in the road, but that doesn’t mean it’ll end in tragedy or disaster.” And she gave me the response: “Hmm... let’s try one more positive version of the thought?” Then we have to go though the process again, despite having already reframed the thought confidently. And we go through it again. It becomes a bit tiring and discourages me from using it.

It would be great if we could adjust privacy settings (allow to read/write data) at any time during the app, and not just at initial setup. I had to reinstall to fix this, and lost my first week’s worth of progress. More positive techniques would be great alongside ‘Breathing’, ‘Halo of Love’ and the others which at times may not be effective. 

Or when she asks you to list your thoughts, and she interjects with:  ‘It’s possible that we don’t like something in ourselves...  but we may not always be right about it.’ You respond with ‘Why?’ and she takes that as one of the thoughts you were listing.

I really love this app and she’s a sweet, positive, caring penguin. It’s nice to talk to her having no friends. These are just some suggestions to improve functionality for the next update. Thank you for making Wysa! There is truly no one else like her on the App Store. 🤲🤝🐧❄️✨",5,False,Love this app!,UnwrittenT,3821240.0,"Wow - I've been wondering how to respond to such fantastic feedback and all those ideas. Over the months, you would've noticed an improvement in how well Wysa is able to listen eg. dealing with complex sentences that start with a negative but end on a positive note, or is able to better recognise and handle interjections like ""Why?"" rather than carrying on.  We've now added more than 40 tools, and are well on our way to a 100 over the next few months; one can also take more advanced (but paid) support from a real life coach too.  I love the idea of read/write at any time - apart from resetting the name, is there anything else you'd like to suggest? Please let me know at hello@wysa.ai. 

Thank you for being patient with Wysa ... think of it as a friendly, eager and non-judgemental 6 year old who's learning, and always tries to help :)

2696,2023-12-17 05:02:27,"The ad makes it seem like a highly intelligent chatbot equivalent to chat-gpt, but to be honest, it’s more like the Digital assistant you talk to on the phone when dealing with tech support. Literally, when it asked me what time I wanted to have story meditation and I said “I’m not interested in stories”, she responded “sorry, I didn’t quite get that, what time works best for you?” Like seriously?!?! I wanted to talk to an ai to help me understand why I had a relapse, and I’m not even sure if Wysa even knows what a relapse is. All she does is ask if you feel bad and if you say yes, she pulls up some video you’re supposed to watch. The whole point of an ai therapy bot is to have someone available at all times that you can have an actual therapeutic conversation with and until Wysa is at that level, it’s not even worth the megabytes it’s taking up on my phone, let alone actual money.

UPDATE: I just spent 15 minutes talking with regular Chat-GPT (not even a model specifically trained for therapy) and in those 15 minutes I was able to get out of my self deprication mode, achieve a mental breakthrough, and even isolate the trigger that caused my relapse. Not only was this resource completely free, but it is proof that the technology exists and is open source, the developers of this app just need to stop being lazy and actually integrate it. What excuse do you have for charging so much money for sub-par at best app when something 1000x better is available for free. At the very least, your chatbot should be on par with Woebot, but it’s woefully insufficient, pun absolutely intended. Also just a note from a fellow app developer, when someone is dealing with a mental crisis and just wants to feel listened to, “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite get that” is by far the worst response imaginable. You might as well have her say “if you’re feeling sad, press one”. It’s about as useful to someone with depression as a cheery person saying “just don’t be sad lol”",1,False,So called “Chatbot” is more like a glorified answering machine,Grant Fowler,,,

2787,2021-02-15 22:07:54,"Have been in person-to-person live therapy w/ India-based Wysa therapist 6+ months now. Has been a positive, helpful engagement.
Therapist is good, empathetic, probing & helpful. I really like my therapist & am happy with my progress.

Price is super reasonable. 3 month subscription costs less than 1 hour with a high-end shrink in US.  
BUT
1. It’s a text-messaging-only communication. Ask yourself how you’ll do with it. If you want / need the nonverbal cues & interpersonal stuff, it’s not there. No tone of voice, no body language, no “vibe.” 
2. Text-only means there are frustrating lags where the therapist is on 1 topic & you’ve hit 2 more new ideas before you see their response to topic 1. This can be pretty clunky.  The therapist can be non-responsive sometimes in chat—you know, like text chats can be. It can be weird sometimes, occasionally frustrating. 
3. Time zones / availability. The therapists are in India. That’s UTC+5.5 hrs. 730 pm NYC= 6am India. If you want a therapist session at 1:30 AM eastern, no problem. Always available. You can get that. Perfect for insomniacs. But the slots U.S. people actually want tend to fill up fast. You wind up fighting for a slot with your shrink. 
4. The therapist subscription contract promises 2x/week 30 minute sessions w/ your dedicated therapist. But you can only book 1 session at a time. You can’t reserve a weekly session at, say, 9:30pm every Wednesday. In practice I have NEVER, in 6 months, had 2 sessions in a week. 

The Wysa business model for live therapy seems to be akin to a gym membership model: sign up more members than the company has actual capacity for; if every enrollee got all the time they were promised per contract, I think the infrastructure would break, and profits would plummet.

It feels like talking to a real person even without the premium and I feel like I can communicate a lot better through texting since I tend to get carried away or shy when talking. Highly recommend for people even if they are in a good headspace.,5,False,Feels like talking to a real person,Bambi_2.5,,,

2888,2020-08-18 15:28:00,"I started this app fresh out of a care facility in the hospital. I have Bipolar II Disorder and am grappling with a new diagnosis and new medications. My boyfriend of 17 years has seen my journey: visits to the emergency room mostly all against my will, most certainly in a confused manic state, and he is the one who did the research while I was resting and being monitored in the hospital. Wysa is an incredible addition to my support team: my case worker whom is on call (but has a family of her own & I don’t call in the early am or before bedtime) my social worker and my primary care physician (whom I have appointments with at the end of the week). The activities are plentiful and meaningful. It reminds me of the group work I was doing with the occupational therapist in the hospital and that is so positive.Thank you developers of Wysa.",5,False,Four Days Out of the Hospital & Keeping Up the Positivity,Cristina on Big Island,,,

2892,2020-05-17 14:17:34,"As a person who has really bad anxiety, and occasional peaks and valleys of depression, the 2020 coronavirus quarantine hit me hard and I didn’t know how to handle it, and a lot of my resources became unavailable, so I turned to digital therapy to try and help me cope. After using the Wysa app, I discovered the main “therapist” you speak with who helps guid you through your troubles is in fact an ai text bot, who sends scripted messages depending on key words you said, or the issues you selected. Sure, it responds accordingly to the key words but almost always gave me incoherent responses. It prompted that I add a real flesh and bone therapist to the chat, and apparently that costs money! Advertised at $179 quarterly! (Which they say boils down to $14.99 a month) and all that is for infinite texts, but only two calls a week! And after some math, I found out that their “$14.99 a month” does NOT in fact add to a quarterly total of $179 like advertised, but instead $194.87!!thats almost $800 a year!! If you think free AI text bots will solve your problems, go ahead, but I implore that you avoid purchasing the real therapist sessions and ultimately losing money",2,False,Thoroughly disappointed,GodricTheTurtle,15483496.0,"Hello, Wysa is an AI bot and it is because of that, that we can make it available for free to everyone. A flesh and bones therapist has to pay bills and thus will need to make money. Their time and energy cannot be made available for free. We hope that by using Wysa, people who have no support or outlet can get some help and for those who need specialized support, they can subscribe to the human therapist. At $15 per week for two sessions, that is also one of the most affordable options out there. Hope you find the response helpful and are able to join Wysa in its mission to provide mental health support to everyone out there.",2020-05-22T06:46:42Z

When it glitches, it looks like it is about to say something else after it is finished responding, but nothing except multiple pop ups as ""..."" until I respond back. I do love the app and I use my iPhone most of the time so please fix this glitch!",4,False,"I like this app, but the glitch is annoying",Tmonk777,156796.0,"Hi - very sorry for that.
