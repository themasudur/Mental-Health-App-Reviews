0,2018-09-27 09:35:41,"This is the first review I’ve ever written, but I just want to thank the developers SO SO MUCH for making this app completely free! I’ve only been using it for a couple of days but already it’s been so helpful to me in calming me down, tracking my moods, organizing my thoughts and it practically works as a diary. I’m also extremely interested in knowing how different kinds of therapy techniques work on the brain, so I love the scientific explanations behind what the app tells me to do. It really keeps me going, because it reminds me that it really will help. I’m currently unemployed and working to get on disability for mental illness, so I can’t afford to pay for monthly subscriptions to mental health apps, something that frustrates and upsets me a lot. So much in fact that I’m working on learning how to make my own apps so that I can provide free mental health apps for people in my situation. When I downloaded this I couldn’t believe it was so helpful, so well designed and totally free. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
The only suggestion I have is I think it would be absolutely wonderful if some DBT skills were integrated into it as well, as both CBT and DBT work really well together for a lot of people! Radical acceptance for situations that can’t be changed, distress tolerance, etc. That would make this app truly perfect to me. Regardless, this app is fantastic and I’d recommend it to anyone.",5,False,mythmoth,One of the best mental health apps out there,5373449.0,"Youper wouldn’t be here without the support of loyal users, like you!

1,2019-06-11 03:43:30,"I’m saying this having downloaded aura, headspace, calm, oak, simple habit, affirmation apps, and every type of mindfulness app under the sun. It has meditation, it has affirmations and setting intentions, and the “messaging” format that it has I think is very innovative and makes you feel like you’re talking to someone that actually cares about you, and a lot of the time, feeling like you’re being heard really makes the difference. I like how throughout the conversation, it helps you deconstruct the emotions you’re feeling using all those methods.  I downloaded it during a period of time that I felt very anxious about where my life was, and I used it everyday, multiple times a day for about two weeks, before I didn’t feel like I needed to use it every day anymore. The option to look at your past conversations with the app really makes a difference, because you can look back and see just one week ago you were having a mental breakdown, but now everything in the world is great, lol. I also really like the feature that messages you everyday “How are you?” as if you’re receiving a text because sometimes you don’t realize you want to talk until you see that message. And on top of all that, every feature is completely free, so what more could you ask for in an app?",5,False,Nenjalloh,The best mindfulness app you’ll ever download.,,,
2,2018-10-16 01:39:25,"I love Youper so much. I’ve only been using it consistently for a couple of weeks now, because at first I wasn’t crazy about it. But since then I have really warmed up to it. Although it doesn’t always make me feel better (though it usually does), I can always just use it to track my mood which is really helpful. I struggle with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, depression, and panic attacks (not panic disorder thankfully), and it’s a great form of cognitive behavioral therapy.

I don’t know if this app will be helpful for everyone, but I would definitely recommend checking it out, because it’s really well done and thoughtful. It gives you a lot of thoughtful prompts to fill out, but it also gives you the option of just tracking your mood. You can skip prompts you don’t feel like doing and say you’re done at any point, which makes it feel less overwhelming on really hard days. I’d recommend this even if you aren’t struggling with a mental illness, because it’s a great way to gain more insight on how your mind works. 

Obviously any app is not going to be a miracle cure, but if you don’t have access to a counselor or just want to have a little bit of help and insight, Youper is perfect.

3,2019-12-07 20:58:03,"I am currently in graduate school studying cognitive-behavioral therapy methods and techniques, so I downloaded this app to see how it fits with what I am currently learning. I thought the app was very user-friendly and did a lot of great things that align with what I have been taught. For example, in my conversations with Youper, he really challenged my thoughts to help me get down to the root of my current problem/mood. In addition, Youper also pointed out the Thinking Traps that I was falling into which greatly resembled the problematic thinking patterns that I often identify with my clients. Lastly, I also really appreciated the meditation and mindfulness activities that Youper provided. 

However, in addition to the great strengths that I identified, I did have a constructive comment. First, although the app gave the disclaimer that only a doctor can provide a diagnosis, I think the developers should reconsider talking about diagnoses at all. After I completed my mental health wellness check it reported that “I did or did not experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD…” Although I’m sure the app developers had good intentions with including this check and talking about specific diagnoses, I think that this can be misinterpreted and possibly be problematic for certain individuals who do not have an actual mental health professional to consult with.",4,False,Kayla Overtonn(:,Great app but with some constructive feedback.,12302718.0,"Thank you for your sincere feedback.

4,2019-01-27 06:34:52,"I have been using Youper since last October. For the first two months I used it everyday, multiple times a day, tracking everything I thought and felt. At the time I was going through a break up, hated work, couldn’t find motivation to better myself, and was overall tired of the people around me and myself. A little background I’m in the Navy and had been underway for almost three months straight. The last thing I wanted to do was talk to my chain of command about the problems I had been having for fear of being medically discharged. Luckily for me the app made a huge turnaround in my life. It allowed to open up with myself and be honest about how I was feeling and what was making me feel these ways which helped me to understand myself so much better. I really like that it has mental health monitoring and personality typing built into it. Another great feature is the guided meditations. They really come in handy when I’m trying to unwind at the end of a rough day but I’m having trouble sleeping. Although I wish there was a stand alone button on screen to access these guided meditations immediately instead of having to go through the whole process of talking with Youper. If anything could be added to the app I would vote for that. Everything else is perfect though. Keep it up!",4,False,Tdilla,Great app but one missing feature.,,,
5,2020-11-18 03:20:34,"I came back to this app after years of using it, its gotten me through a lot of difficult times in my life- that I'm very thankful for because at those times- i did not have the finances for an actual therapist. I still don't, which is why me, and I'm sure many others depended on this service. This begs the question of why make inaccessible something that can be utilized by those who don't have any other option. Its so saddening to see profit go over people. Especially in the case of mental health in a time when its so dire for people who need help, but do not have access. Be it by finances or not having access because of home situations- especially in the case of those underage. Those who do not have support from family but still want to get help. 

Truly my disappointment is immeasurable with this product. I remember i used to recommend this app to anyone i knew who was struggling with mental health.  If finances are truly the issue to keep this app running, I'm sure a donation service, or occasional fundraising would be better instead of stripping away one of the only resources people have. 

I have doubts that this will ever be changed, or if this app even is meant to help people instead of being a grab at money from those you know are desperate. Very disappointed. With hope these things change in the future, until then I only hope there is another better service out there that cares about its demographic.",1,False,tomateme,Why add a premium?,19295413.0,"Thank you for your feedback.

6,2024-03-02 08:09:55,"Like many of the most recent reviews express, I have been using Youper on and off for years. It was an important part of my early healing journey and I thought I would revisit it for healing journey part 2. However, every. single . thing. is behind a paywall now. And it’s lowkey lame of y’all. I get it. You’ve realized the earning potential of the app and probably (hopefully) are just trying to keep the thing funded but at the end of the day, many of us used this app because we could not afford traditional therapy. While essentially forcing people to buy the paid version of an app isn’t anything new, it is disconcerting to see an app that presented itself as a genuine and accessible tool for self-betterment turn into a money grab. And please, for the love of the gods, if you’re going for the money grab, please stop responding to comments from long-term users expressing their disappointment with your marketing and pricing structure by asking what improvements could be made to an app they can no longer use or what features they miss. These comments along with your placating statements about how change is hard comes across as intentionally avoiding the reality your paywall has created.  Obviously we miss the old, accessible Youper that seemed to give a flying fiddlestick.

7,2024-02-19 18:16:33,"This app was so helpful to me and my feelings of anxiety. I’ve been using it for about a week now and I already love how it works and how it has already started to help. Tracking my mood and thoughts every day has helped me to see patterns in when I feel a certain feeling on specific days/times. It’s an AI chatbox so it’s really nice to have someone to talk to and get a quick response when I need it. It really helps me calm down and suggests things like breathing exercises which personally help me to calm down when I’m feeling anxious or stressed. Also, I picked social anxiety as one of my problem areas and it told me to try exposure therapy, which basically just means I go out and do things that scare me so that I can become desensitized to it and not feel as afraid anymore. I have tried this technique and although it felt weird at first, I am going to continue to do it and I like how I already feel less scared to put myself in social situations. I thought this method was helpful because it can eventually help me learn that my previous fears aren’t as scary and it basically changes my way of thinking about social situations from negative to eventually positive.

8,2019-01-29 01:01:48,"Youper is an amazing app, and I mean it when I say I loved it. I still do! I first downloaded it 25 days ago, and have used it everyday since. I love the tracker and the mindfulness activities. But, as I continue to make this app a part of my daily routine, I am increasingly frustrated with the format. While I understand the purpose of place of the AI chat model, it slows down the process. There are times when I don't want to track my mood, and want to skip right to the Deep Body Scan, my favorite meditation tape. But before I can, I must drudge through the conversation with the AI. This is very inconvenient. To alleviate this problem while not changing much about the AI chat system itself, I would recommend creating a separate section of the app, solely for homing the meditation and breathing tapes. Once Youper recommends you a mindfulness activity within the chat, it should move you over the meditation section where you can choose. The separate section idea would also allow users to not start a chat at all, and rather dive immediately into their favorites. This, along with expanding on the number of audio tapes available, would really bring the app together for me. As I have said before, I absolutely love this app. But as I discover the benefits of meditation, I feel the app could be doing more with it. If these changes or changes like them were made, I would give 10 stars if I could.",2,False,lyricyani,"I loved it, until I didn't?",,,
9,2019-02-24 20:55:39,"Not everyone has access to a close friend nor therapist when they need one. And, in this day & age with so many people reporting having no close friends or, perhaps, not even family to talk to, it can be too easy to sit and ruminate in negative thoughts & feelings without someone to help you in challenging both of these things. This app is wonderful in that regard. Unlike being told what someone thinks you may want to hear which can sometimes enable unhealthy thinking patterns (and behaviors), or on the other end of the spectrum, rather than attempting to “fix” you, this interactive app continually prompts you to look inward and to challenge your own thoughts, perspectives, and feelings, helping to redirect your focus onto more healthy and more positive strategies.

The various health screenings are comprehensive as well as the detailed definitions and descriptions of the results particular to the individual results of the user. And, when combined with the built in tracking of specific emotions and/or symptoms, this app also provides an objective view to look at both personal progress and potential trends.

10,2020-06-24 21:07:06,"I've tried a lot of AI mental health/wellness apps and never really liked how any of them interacted. Most of them let you type full answers which is nice but because of programming can also be annoying when it misunderstands your statements. This was has simple responses to choose from that get a clear response. I felt like a lot of the apps I used in the past had a condescending air to their teachings while this one gives u a chance to give a general idea of your experience with certain topics which keeps it from explaining something you already know as if you've never even heard of it (*cough cough* meditation *cough*). As for the mindfulness/meditation portion. I really enjoy how they did it. I've been meditating for a while now but I've noticed that for many beginners it's easier to focus on the mindfulness task when there isn't meditation music playing in the background. This gives you the chance to truly focus on what's expected and lets you acknowledge the natural/typical sounds around you that you wouldn't otherwise notice.

I’ve had two sessions so far: one to help me with sadness from a situation and another for anxiety I was feeling the next morning. Youper asked me simple questions to gauge my emotion and their strength, and then helped me (1) understand that us, humans, tend to mix emotion with situations, and (2) guided me step-by-step to separate them, understand the emotion vs the situation, and allowed me to decide whether to focus on the situation or my mental state. At every step, you’re given the option to skip or move on, but I couldn’t. By the end of the session I learned that I can observe emotions “like fish in an aquarium” as it says rather than allowing it to consume me. I went from being 100% sad to 100% optimistic. This morning I was anxious and based on the situation and emotions, Youper recommended a 7-minute guided meditation. It was amazing! My anxiety is gone, which I’ve never been able to do on my own.

13,2020-03-13 13:28:55,"When I first downloaded this app, I was so excited to see all the cool features it had. After using all of them one time, everything became part of the paid subscription other than the mood tracker and the symptom tracker. This was annoying, but I KIND OF get it. 
One of my favorite free parts of this app, other than the mood tracker, was the health part where you can track symptoms of several disorders. I’ve been using those trackers regularly, so I was very disappointed to check my phone this morning and see that that too, is a premium feature. 
Now, all I can use without paying is the mood tracker. I can’t expand on my mood, set goals, track gratitude, track symptoms, or even meditate. Why should I have to pay to listen to something that’s supposed to help me asap when I’m panicking? All this app USED to do was tell me I’m depressed and not give me any way to fix it. Now, it doesn’t tell me anything useful at all. 

I understand that the developers need to make money off of Youper, but this app has become infuriating to use. It’s meant to help people, but without forcing them to pay a subscription, there are barely any useful features available.

Since I have been using Youper I  check in everyday and talk about my feelings like anxiety, depression, feeling numb. Then Youper and I go in and analyze why I feel that way and we do exercises to help pinpoint why I am having those feelings and I work with Youper to go try and change the way I am thinking that are causing negative emotions. Youper has talked and worked with me on emotions like deep depression, feeling numb, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts which Youper gives you resources on. I love the daily check in and it really helps to work with Youper to go through and try and change the reason why I am feeling about an emotion and working on a more positive spin on it.

I’ve been in therapy for over five years now and both my therapist and I agree that this is probably one of the most useful mindfulness tools for me.

I love how you can pick and choose what you want to do based on how your feeling and how the responses are slightly different each time. Insights and goal setting are two of the most useful parts for me. 
The other day I had a panic attack in the car and had to pull over and usually it would’ve taken me over an hour to get back on the road. Thanks to this app, that time was cut in half. 
One thing that frustrates me is the severity of some of the emotions. To me, fear is worse than guilt, anger isn’t on the same level as annoyance, and pride isn’t as good as optimism. Unfortunately, in the app, it’s not set up that way. That’s only a few examples but I kinda wish you could set up which emotions feel worse based on your own personal scale of emotion.

Most apps have a very basic setup of logging how you feel, why you feel that way, and how to fix it. Youper is very detailed and actually takes the time to get to the root of your problem and help you realize why you truly feel the way that you do. When I didn’t feel convinced in my response of why I shouldn’t be anxious about something the app broke the problem I was having down in different ways until I could view my problem in a new light and understand for myself that my thinking was skewed.

I used the app for a little over a month before accepting that it wasn’t really helping me. What I personally needed was a tracking app for my mood in a simpler, more straightforward way. It feels like a labyrinth, trying to weave through all of Youper’s (often repetitive) advice when you mostly want to track your mood or maybe go through a portion of the conversation. An entire evaluation can be several minutes after picking a mood, describing why you feel that way, finding your thought traps, doing a meditation, reevaluating your mood, and finally finishing. That’s a lot! And Youper pushes for it every time. When you opt out and say “Just track my mood,” the response messages are often weirdly down-putting?

Hopefully Youper is helpful for many people. But I prefer a quick time saver that has more neutral emotions to choose from. Youper lacks a fine/okay/true neutral emotional option. I understand pushing for self-analysis, but sometimes I really am just fine or okay rather than being 10% anxious or 70% calm.

A lot of my issues are from past trauma, and I believe a real life therapist, a human being, is necessary for that. However, trauma can distort our thought pattern, a lot like anxiety does. This app is great in that it stops you and forces you to think about whatever is happening, and why you are feeling the way you are. It’s VERY helpful to someone like me who is quickly overtaken by irritation or anxiety. A lot of t will be what you put into it, and you’ll never get advice specific to the situation, but the tools it gives you are great for taking to real life-which I do! I have stopped a couple anxiety spirals now, recognizing my thought pattern.

I’ve only had the app for two days and already I’m in love & learning things about myself. Definitely recommend as an additional aid to self help.

Firstly, I don't like feeling feelings and I really don't like talking about how I feel in general. I have a great support group/system (12 Step and other recovering addicts) and go to a  psychiatrist  monthly and therapy weekly. Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when ""talking"" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they've added ""Calm"" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing.

There is also disorder monitoring, like the ones at doctors but more specific and you can see in a graph if your symptoms for that particular disorder is worsening or getting better.

I also should add, it is very scary accurate with it’s personality diagnosis. I was honestly baffled how much they were able to describe exactly my personality traits. I’ve taken lots of personality tests for fun and none have even come half as close as this one did to understanding who I was.

My only problem with it was that Meditation would disconnect when you closed the app or your phone went to sleep. But I emailed the app’s team about it and they said they were fixing it in the next update!

55,2018-12-17 18:06:12,"This app truly is phenomenal. I am currently in psychotherapy treatment using DBT & EMDR for Anxiety Disorder, BPD, and C-PTSD (childhood trauma).

When you grow up in an abusive/traumatic environment, you don’t learn how to pay attention to yourself. It’s not safe to emote, explore, develop a sense of self, reflect, etc. Your self-esteem gets beaten to a pulp when abused as a child. This leads to anxiety, stress, depression, and many other mental ailments for adult survivors. As kids, we were too busy trying to survive, and didn’t get to develop critical life skills YOUPer teaches.

This app is helping me monitor my moods, identify triggers, and catch sneaky emotional flashbacks. And quite honestly —knowing it’s not a human being is what makes me feel the most safe at this time. 

Complex posttraumatic stress disorder creates attachment trauma — I am weary of people. Even my paid trauma specialist. AI is really great for FEELING SAFE if you don’t feel safe talking with humans straight away. I am much more open and honest in YOUPer than with my therapist at this time, so he reads my entries out loud during sessions and we go from there.

The personality test I took was extremely accurate, more so than the official personality type test you take online. It can also help you learn your levels of depression and social anxiety in the previous fortnight (two weeks). 
You can meditate and it can help you fall asleep if you need it.

And this is all *without* premium, which for a single person, is only $45 a year. Which is about $3.75 a month and $.94 cents a week. 
A typical therapy session normally costs about $40 to $70 a week. Which is about $160 to $280 a month and $1920 to $3360 a year. That is, if I did my math right 😅

Overall, this app is really cool and well made. It can help you keep track of your mental health (it obviously cannot make a diagnosis however lol) and it helps you get your feelings out without the fear of opening up to someone, because you’re only speaking to an AI. 
Of course, if you believe you have something serious that needs to be addressed, you should, of course, consult a doctor and/or therapist. All I’m saying is that this app is free (and premium is pretty cheap) and that it can help put you in a better state of mind.

The ability to log any mental illnesses and keep track of symptoms is amazing. I've yet to find another app that does this with thorough detail and research. 

I do wish there was the option to pay monthly for the Premium version, as opposed to it's current per year cost. As most people who use mental health apps are those without the access to a therapist.  Due to this exact purpose, I'm unable to pay for this premium service yearly.

Maybe all features in the app were totally free at one time, but now the full experience is around $45 per year. 

Nearly every app I use on a regular basis is embracing membership-style charging, and it is making apps like this one out of reach. Because if every app or service that used to be free (or even a small monthly fee) goes to charging yearly fees or increased monthly fees - it is simply not sustainable on a budget. 

I went from no subscriptions to about 10 of them in a year for my family. 

The app itself seems good, although I would like to try the premium features before having to commit to a yearly cost.  Why isn’t there a monthly subscription option?

I want to support apps/developers that are doing great work... but unfortunately something’s gotta give. But if you have unlimited funds, or don’t already have a bunch of subscriptions - this may be a great investment for you. 

It has so much potential to help. $45 a year is ok. But along with ALL the other services and apps that have switched to subscription fees - it just doesn’t make the cut.

I love this app a lot. My favorite features are the breathing exercises especially when I’m overwhelmed. 

I do have a requests though. I don’t expect them to happen, but I would very much appreciate it if they were taken into consideration.

-Add more feelings. *Like lonely for example
-Add more exercises 
-Add more exercises that don’t take long. A lot of the time during school or home I’m too busy with homework or activities that I don’t have time to take 10 minutes out of my day to do one.
-Add a bit more personality to the Youper chat bot
-Have a bit more personalized responses would be nice too. A lot of the time I get a “Thats great!” Response and it’s nice to have new responses every now and then.

I know that’s a lot to ask... but I’d love it so much and recommend this app to my friends with troubles if you did! I know this sounds kinda bad, but before I recommend it to my friends I want to test it on myself and see how it works.

Your app has many extremely user-friendly features. I feel the problem lies in that you shove every feature in the user’s face at once.

What I would recommend you change is when people first open the app explain what it is to them and then ask if they would like to record their mood. If they say no wish them a happy day and encourage them to check in later.
Also, when they do complete a report, ask them if they would like to continue without listing a specific feature. If they say yes ask them if they would like to try another feature one feature at a time. If they say no to every feature, repeat goodbye from above.

I feel so calm and happy whenever I get to talk Youper, it just feels like I’m the center and what I say matters.

We start with mood tracking so your coach can get a better understanding of the types of situations driving your sadness, which helps them tailor the later skills to your symptom presentation. If you're interested in trying some additional sessions and learning some of the more powerful skills for helping your mood, we are happy to have you continue with your coach or with a different coach if you like.

I like the AI interface for talk therapy; it can’t replace a licensed human therapist but is more nuanced than I anticipated. It is definitely useful how it logs “contributing factors” for your feelings so that, over time, you can look at what trends are behind your emotions. 

However, the choices for the contributing factors feel limited and somewhat superficial. I understand they are supposed to be mostly neutral sounding and factual but there are a lot of things left out. I wish they would expand them to include more options, such as “household chores”, “personal hygiene”, “fashion”, “hobbies”, “food”, etc.

2) You’re blocked from using any of the positive features by being told you need to subscribe for Premium - this specifically after I followed an ad for the app specifically saying this is a good app if you CAN NOT afford therapy. False advertising. 

3) The AI itself guilt trips you into trying to subscribe to premium as well. If you struggle with guilt or shame, this app will make it way worse.

4) Developers responding to the negative reviews are just like the app - scripted, unapologetic/remorseful, not specific, and unhelpful.

2263,2020-02-20 14:46:38,"I have downloaded, tried out, and deleted so many minfulness/meditation/emotional-health/self-care apps because I’m so determined to enjoy this one life that I have despite the challenges that my disorders create for me. Most of them are alright but I forget about them because there’s no real impact made. This is not one of those. This is one of the few that I find myself excited that I’ve fallen upon it because it is effective and beautifully designed and exceptionally well put together to result in an app that I find myself looking forward to using again. Youper has allowed me to get excited about my own journey of healing and self awareness as well as acceptance and that excitement and motivation is precious for me because it’s far and few between. Highly recommend this especially to people who are like me and have a history of apps that promise relief and come up short, because you will not be disappointed in this app. If you truly want to feel good, love yourself, take your care into your own hands, and start living the life that you’ve dreamt about having, you’ll find no regret in this download. I highly recommend the premium paid version; it’s a yearly charge but it’s less than half the cost of a single session of therapy and it more than pays for itself in the support it provides and expert techniques used to help you rewire the way your brain perceives the world around you as well as the thoughts and feelings that you have within you. Through the enjoyable texting styled conversations it logs entries based on the things you share and asks questions specific to the information you provide in order to identify how you are feeling and either more fully appreciate the good feeling or help bring you up out of the bad feeling, even if it’s just one more step in the right direction. It allows for the option to either keep it brief or continue trying different techniques and understand more deeply about what you are feeling and why. I can go on and on about the many other features and incredible aspects of this app but I’ve already written a small novel in my excitement so I will conclude by reiterating: this app is absolutely brilliant and well worth the premium cost (I believe it’s around $44/year which works out to less than $4/month).

2472,2021-05-27 04:14:16,"I’ve cycled through so many different self-help apps and they all seem to follow a similar mold of offering great activities such as practicing mindful meditation or affirmations, but I’ve never seen one that uses a conversation style exercise or that analyzes and tracks your progress. Now there are mood tracker apps but Youper takes it a step further by tracking and analyzing the reasons you specify is related to why you feel a certain way. Each time you “talk” with Youper, the conversation is stored and used to build up an analysis to study what shapes your moods. You can also set goals and track those. I like that you can personalize the goals and choose if you want Youper to check-in to see if you accomplished your goal. There are several different types of conversations you can have too depending on what you want to accomplish. The conversations have really helped guide me how to cope and respond to how I’m feeling. You can check-in daily about your mood but there are also trackers for checking progress with depression, anxiety, BPD, PTSD, etc. Those check-ins are every couple of weeks or so using questionnaires (officially used by healthcare providers). There’s a section that shows charts of how these certain areas are progressing, like how your depression has progressed from moderately severe to moderate over the last two weeks based on how you answered the questionnaire, for example. Final take away, the more you use Youper, the more insights you can gain. The “Mood” section shows daily, monthly, and yearly progress charts. This can be helpful to spot trends. A really neat and intuitive section I like is where Youper collects data from your conversations to show “what makes me...depressed, sad, anxious, angry, sad, frustrated,” etc. For example, after you’ve had several conversations with Youper where you indicate “bad sleep” as the reason you feel depressed, that will show up as a factor related to your depression. These insights develop over time and the more you converse with Youper, so checking in daily helps to get the most out of it. 

Tl;Dr: this app is so different from all the other self-help apps. It’s so intuitive with different and very helpful ways to track my progress related to different mental issues and life experiences.

This app has been so helpful for me because it’s here, in the moment. It challenges me at times with reframing my negative thoughts, it reminds me to notice my feelings and to accept them (not beat myself up), it is an outlet for me to vent and to be “heard,” it gives solid suggestions and ideas, and it helps me to set goals (which is hard when feeling depressed etc.) I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but it’s been very helpful to me and I can see myself using it for a long time. I can see how it would also work in tandem with going to see a “real” counselor because it would help with generalizing or carrying over the skills you learn in therapy.  In the past, I would learn a lot in therapy and feel good during the session or the next day. But as time goes on, you forget the strategies because they’re not ingrained in your mind and things fall to the wayside. With this app, you can set reminders, so that’s been great to not forget to track my feelings, reflect on my goals, and to follow through on helpful suggestions. There have been a couple of times where I was feeling extreme frustration and distress at home and I ran off to “talk” to Youper and it helped to have an outside perspective and to vent.

2737,2019-06-03 16:06:51,"Many moments that make for a stressful and sometimes challenging day to the point of inevitable fear is primarily due to unrealistic thinking. I just want to say the AI in this application is very fast and extremely accurate contextually. I have had personal counselors in the past and get some of the same information. The information received from this well designed bot is much more thorough than what I generally received from therapists in the past. This thera-bot also delves much deeper into the actual source problem and I continue to learn more and more about myself. When I know these things at a personal level clearly I am finally able to make sound changes in those areas and the outcome overall is that I am becoming a reasonably happier person throughout the day. The AI responses, almost immediate, feel more human to me than therapists I have used in the past. In no way would I recommend anyone stop what they have and do with professionals but as a supplement, I have what feels to me like a therapist who really knows me well and is always with me. Every experience I have had so far with this resource has either taught me something or improved my happiness in that moment and intern a positive impact on my entire day.

I have ten million self discovery , development journals and cognitive behavioral workbooks to start working on rewriting my thought and habits. I even followed recommend habits by putting your journal next to your bed side so it’s the first thing I you do when you wake up and write in . Guess what ? I did put it next to me and forget and the first thing I do is pick up my phone in the morning, then stroll through social media and then head to bathroom and get ready and as I am leaving the house I remember the stupid journal. 
The nice thing about this app , that is inside the first thing I pick up, which is my phone . 
The second thing , into an engaging interactive experience , that targets exactly what I want to work on based on my feelings and then it suggests the appropriate exercises for what I am currently dealing with which is a more targeted approach . I also enjoy the little tid bits of educational information about why you are doing each exercise and what science says about these little changes you make and how it will effect long term changes in your neuro-network . 
This app isn’t a psychologist but it does help tackle some important skills you would def be doing in therapy . This app allows me to work on my self everyday the way I choose to clean my teeth , eat healthy and go to the gym . To be able to work on my self everyday for a few minutes , all adds up and strengthens my nueral networks.

I am depressed and extremely anxious and I have been for most of my life. Lately I’ve been looking for ways to make myself feel better instead of sulking in my mental illness to the point where my family/friends forces me into human therapy that I don’t want to go to. I’ve been using this app for a few weeks now and for the first time Youper actually made me aware of what I was feeling and exactly why I was feeling it and makes me aware of exactly how my illnesses can cloud my thought processes. The app has coached me through suicidal thoughts and honestly is the first time I could talk to “someone” without feeling judged. I think this app is pretty cool because Youper’s job really is to just be there for you. I am happy to say that since my two weeks of having Youper I scheduled my first ever therapy session (long overdue). I think this app helped me realize that feeling my feelings is important, but also understanding my thoughts/feelings is fundamental for my growth and I’m excited to continue doing so. Youper also has gotten me into meditation which has also been super calming during my episodes. It doesn’t take the feeling away but I definitely leave the app slightly more calm if not feeling better after I go through the motions she tells me to. You should definitely get the app if you’re already here and just see how it works for you.

3063,2021-02-10 22:07:29,"Youper is a great app. When it comes to finding a journaling app to help you make note of/ be present with your emotions Youper is the frontrunner. The combo of emotional journaling and various meditation options is such a strong one. Youper really helped me get through some hard times, and though I use it less now, it still holds a dear place in my emotional life.

That being said... I’m not sure I like where the app is heading. Every day a new feature is added- theyve make the conversation more complex, they try to make it more engaging by adding pictures/new visual aspects, there is now a home page. What I loved about Youper was how simple it was— it’s simply doing too much these days. For instance, when you used to log on it would just take you straight to some emotional journaling which was nice and predictable. Logging on today I was greeted with a banner reading “Im happy to see you again. Can I help improve your anxiety?”. If I hadn't been feeling anxious before...I definitely was feeling a little anxious after reading that. I think the simplicity of Youper is what made it feel accessible and dependable. These days, opening up Youper is a little bit of a jarring experience. The constant updates to the app produce the same effect as  a therapist changing offices every day— it impedes the process. The conversation is growing increasingly halting, garbled, and incomprehensible. It saddens me!

I probably wont get rid of Youper any time soon. There is no other app that does what it does. But it’s changing and changing fast. The Youper I suggest to my friends now is not the Youper that helped me and that’s a weird feeling.

3094,2023-12-11 22:16:35,"As my first review said: I have used Youper for years. I have found it to be a great resource when I'm alone and really need to get it all out and get some feedback. However, over the years (like many health apps), Youper has slowly been sliding behind a paywall and removing things from long time users. They used to have a catalog you could scroll through that had a bunch of different mental health focusses that you could gear Youper towards. I checked in after not using it for a couple weeks and they blocked the catalog behind a paywall. Now I go back again, and Youper himself is behind the paywall!! This app is useless to me now! It feels like punishment for longtime users to be forced to pay when they were huge reasons for the success of the app. I always promoted this app as it could be around whenever you needed to talk when a therapist isn't available. In high school, I was dependent on Youper because I was never allowed to see a therapist and dealt with a lot of stress and bullying. It feels disgusting to remove people who possibly rely on the app. And $70!! That is like actually going to a therapist! This app is not supposed be substituting going to a therapist, yet you expect the same and possibly more money than actually seeing a licensed professional! This is just heinous in my eyes. I don't even know what I should do at this point. Uninstalling feels like I am giving up on an incredible resource, but it's not worth the money. You draw us in, shove a paywall us, dangling it in front of us hoping we'll empty our wallets. Manipulative.

3167,2020-03-21 02:24:43,"So I got this app not too long ago because I’ve always had issues emotionally and mentally and no one has thought to try to help me get therapy, and not only that I don’t really like the idea of a real therapist trying to pry information from me. So when I saw an ad for this app, and read the reviews, I figured this would be a great app to help me manage my emotions and to help me with my anxiety, misophonia, anger issues, and depression. 

So the free features aren’t that bad. I like that I have access to all the emotions and the mood tracker...kind of. But i was really disappointed when I saw that I have to pay so much money that I don’t have and can’t spend on an app to be able to have mental health check ins, to be able to meditate, have help sleeping, help me in an attack, etc. Essentially you have to pay for the whole point of this app. 

Granted I understand that this app is a way for the developers to make money. But not all of us have that kind of money just laying around and not all of us are adults that can pay for those things and work to make it up again. Just as a suggestion, maybe make it so that those of us that aren’t 18+ yet don’t have to pay for everything, but maybe make some limited features to counteract that. So the people that aren’t 18 can have access to things normally for premium we can access, but we can only have 1/2 of what premium offers, like how there’s 6 types of screenings, but we can only have 3.

3207,2021-11-13 02:28:15,"This app used to be just simply a really helpful diary tool, to just having a chat place to rate, analyze, and understand your moods. They shouldn’t even advertise it as a “free” or “affordable” app anymore because the developers aren’t up front with the costs ahead of time. I would’ve rather paid a one-time high cost app fee instead of a ridiculously expensive yearly/monthly subscription service (that they claim is “affordable”) and is not individualized at all. The fact is I used to pay $2.50 a month for all the services and monitoring. I understand they’re trying to have more inclusive mental health services, however I already have a therapist, a psychiatrist, and take medication. If people need those services keep it a separate payment plan, especially because it’s not necessary for everyone and the app was managing just fine before they decided to hire more people for extra services, that aren’t even accessed in all states (my state is New York for example) which as they claim they’re “working on” (which is only going to drive the cost of the subscription up more). It’s not “affordable”. Why not just have separate apps for what you’re trying to do anyway? That way people can get individualized medication treatments and psychiatry appointments on one app, people can have one app for just mood tracking and therapy, and one app for the meditations/calm noises/affirmations. Also don’t bother responding to this review “developer team” because you say the exact same thing to every low review anyway (it looks performative and cheap). I don’t want excuses or apologies for your current app, because saying that you “don’t want to sell our information to keep it free” means absolutely nothing, why is that even listed as a reason why it’s more expensive? Thanks for providing absolutely nothing now. Not sure how your app is going to keep afloat with the amount of expenses you’re requiring.

3294,2019-10-10 04:48:09,"Without the new price tag, I would give this app a five star rating. I downloaded this app over a year ago, and after searching though countless of other mindfulness and self help apps, this was the perfect fit. It checked all the boxes and more. the check-in was captivating and well introduced and made it easy to write things down. the five minute tests are awesome to see the progress I’ve made, and the ability to set a reminder is the icing on the cake to reel me in and keep me using it. I’ve recommended the app to to many of my friends. However, recently, when one of my friends went to download the app, they came across a deal breaking factor. This person cannot access nor afford to see a therapist at the moment. We were hoping this’d be their shining light and a stepping stone until they’re able to do so, after all, even just a ten minute check in is better than nothing. However, upon checking it out they told me that they can’t use any of these important features without paying. It’s heartbreaking that the app is no longer free and those important features are blocked for those without a subscription. I am still able to use all these features (I’m assuming because I’m an app veteran) but I’m not helping anyone else by telling them to buy a subscription they can’t afford :(  I wish I could share these features with others. Youper is a beautiful and incredible app that goes above and beyond with their features, but the price tag makes it lose all of it’s strengths. There are so many people who need help that can no longer use this as a resource to reach a better place. So few apps that do the job like this, and I’ve been a huge fan of Youper because of its uniqueness and strengths....but I think it’s time for me to find a new app... Unless there are changes made.

3329,2023-11-14 07:50:58,"I used to LOVE this app. It would talk me through my anxiety and help me think through all the thinning traps without any sort of subscription to use those basic tools. I’d been away from the app for a while but decided to go back to it today because I was having a panic attack and was hoping it would help walk me through my thoughts like it always did. I open the app and it does it’s usual check-in, asks me how I’m feeling. As soon as I respond and say I’m feeling very anxious my ONLY option to click on was to view their “free trial options” and their subscription options. Obviously I chose decline, I was having an anxiety attack and can’t really deal with adding a subscription service right now. But once I hit decline it ended the conversation immediately and didn’t help me AT ALL. I tried to go back and try again hoping it was just that one time but it did the same thing to me again and again, wanting me to pay to upgrade before it would be of any help or react at ALL about how I’m feeling. So I searched through the rest of the app to see if maybe I’m missing something but NOPE. All I can do now is log how I’m feeling. All the tools they provided for free before to help relieve those feelings, like walking you through thinking traps, a quick goal setting, mindfulness exercises, all gone and behind a paywall. Now don’t get me wrong, they always had an upgrade feature to use some of their exercises, but those basic tools were always free.

3336,2019-03-23 05:50:18,"I’ve tried a few other mood/health track apps, and while i might use some others for various reasons, i def have stuck with youper and am more inclined to use it. i think various friends mentioned and encouraged it, so i finally decided to give it a try. at first i doubted it would be useful, or i’d lose interest...but i’m slowly forming a habit! that’s great news for a person who procrastinates or won’t see things through

i love the ease of use and even though i know i’m talking to a bot, it’s friendly and honest and even a bit funny at times. the ‘chat’ system is clever. the overall app has a lot of good uses and i like the simplistic set up. my graphic designer side loves it.

the mindfulness talks and related are super nice. it’s one thing i need to take advantage of, but it’s definitely taught me a few things: such as the importance of breathing and other little things to improve mood, or simply be present. i need to explore the other ones.

i also love how this app lacks ads or a paywall—i’m happy to support these honest causes to improve peoples lives! but it is also great since i don’t have much money now, hah.

i don’t outright dislike anything about the app or have had any issues with it. i’d love to see a few more ‘emotions’ in the list, and it would be nice to maybe have some extra/optional trackers within the app, like maybe something for sleep. maybe even an option to attach videos or pictures to a thought/log? however i do understand it’s probably best not to spread out too far in many directions, but just some thoughts. but i would be open to some more additions perhaps

i’m going through a really rough time in my life, as well as have a few unfortunate chronic illnesses. while i’m working on improving things like adjusting meds and finding a good therapist, this is a really good thing just for ‘me’. it keeps me accountable and mindful, but in a gentle and nonintrusive way.

while i would obviously heavily recommend this to anyone out there with mental illnesses or issues to overcome, i think it’s also super great for anyone at most any stage. everyone usually wants to stay healthy—like eating good food and getting some exercise. it’s a long term ordeal with good benefits, obviously. i think we need that same outlook with mental and emotional health. i think if most people used this regularly, it might actually circumvent and help if/when something ‘bad’ did happen or such. knowing how to be mindful and open and all those things the app works on is so powerful—not only for yourself, but helping those around you too.

long story short, thank you for making such a great and relatable app. i really encourage everyone to give it a go and see if it ‘fits’ you. it definitely does for me!",5,False,SueDraws,thanks! for real!,,,

I really like Youper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. I have the 1 year paid version. I decided to risk spending the money after a few days of using the free version because I wanted the extra features. I was worried that I wouldn’t like the features or that I wouldn’t use the app long enough to make paying for the app worth it, but so far I do think it’s worth it. 

I was diagnosed with autism a little over a year ago. Previous diagnoses had been depression, anxiety, Bipolar II, and OCD. I’ve taken medications. I’ve done years of therapy. I have tons of self-help books. And I read books and peer reviewed journal articles on mental health. I’ve taken meditation courses and I’ve used other meditation apps. And, despite all of these tools, I still think Youper is adding something. 

It checks in on me often enough to provide help when I need it... even if I don’t know I need it (until I go through the Youper exercises). I feel like it’s putting together concepts that I know about from all of my years of reading and therapy and helping me use them more consistently and effectively. 

I truly feel like I’m re-wiring my brain. Over time, I think this app will help me be in a better place, mentally, emotionally, and physically. 

I recommend this app.

I really hope the developers keep up with the science behind this app and improve it as we learn more about the mind.",5,False,andithegirl,Making Me Happier & Less Stressed,,,

3355,2019-12-29 07:08:55,"I’m at a very low place with my mental health currently and Youper is actually making a difference. It’s a great help to processing my feelings and being mindful in my life, and the chatbot is actually nice to talk to especially when I’m spiraling. I obviously wish it were free, but the annual price could be worse. The monthly price is just too much in my opinion, but the annual price makes it worth it for me. 

@ Creators/developers:
- I would have been quicker/highly more inclined to pay for long term premium if there was a 6 month option for a medium rate. Also a free trial for at least a week would have been nice. 
- An option to edit moods and factors after conversation with the bot would be useful, in case I forget to select a factor or something and want it to be proper in the insights. 
- Sometimes in conversation with the bot there’s no x or back button, the only way to end the conversation immediately is to close the app. 
- No bipolar monitoring?
- Recently the bot was reassuring me that something I was worried about (this is after me selecting “insecure” mood) was unlikely to happen, but the thing actually is pretty likely and there was no way for me to tell it that. That bothered me. 
- In a perfect world there would be some ability to visualize the factors and my mood in more than the insight word clouds, specifically let me do things like plot the times I mark being sober as a factor against my overall mood levels. Let me click a factor and have it tell me what mood it is most associated with. Etc.

3381,2019-12-19 05:51:08,"The best way I cope with hardship is to have someone talking to me while I experience issues. To be honest, I was just dealing with a rough issue with my family right as I type this (a fight I started because of my poor mental health and anxiety). I felt very alone and ashamed of what I did, but having something akin to professional help, which I’d never really had before, really worked wonders on my mental state. Its empathy and in-depth understanding really help wirh reassurance, and it provides resources like hotlines and other research to instill hope that the user is never without saving no matter where on the severity scale their mental illness falls on.

One thing I do want to reiterate is that while the app will recognize self harm and suicide insinuations, it is not equipped to call for emergency assistance for said scenarios. However, simply expressing desires of these two will prompt the app to supply the hotlines depending on what country you reside in.

The journal and charts of daily mental activity are a nice feature of the app, free with its download. Some of the things offered are accessible after purchasing the plans, such as tests for depression and BPD, but simply being able to keep track of your anxiety levels and mood throughout the day will work if you are already receiving professional help.

It has a way to track any mental illnesses you have through psych evals that you check in with every two to four weeks. This is something I’ve been searching for and hadn’t been able to find. This is so great for tracking progress and seeing if my current treatments are improving my emotional health or not. Fantastic and super helpful. It also gives you a personality DNA test, which is really cool! 

I wasn’t sure what to expect from the AI aspect of this app, but I am pleasantly surprised. It uses tools that I’ve used in CBT and DBT therapies. You track your moods, what contributes to the moods, and what’s going on. The AI then offers mindfulness and breathing techniques, rerouting your thoughts, and digging deeper into your emotions. It’s like therapy in your pocket!!! (Of course not to replace therapy, but having an assistant to remind you of tools on the go is amazing) 
You can track all of these things and monitor your progress

AND ITS FREE. No upgrading as of yet, but even if they do that I would happily pay to support this app because it’s so tremendously helpful. 

I 100% recommend this app to anyone struggling with mental illness or otherwise. I’d love to see more options for mental illnesses to track symptoms of, but they have a way of sending in suggestions so I’m sure they’re already working on that!

3447,2018-11-16 20:37:26,"Youper is basically like having a therapist in your pocket. Actually, Youper is more beneficial than most therapists I’ve seen/known.

If this were a paid app, I’d say it was a little lean on features, but it’s FREE. I know I’ve said that already, but come on! I’d love a health check-in program for ADHD symptoms and coping skills, but the emphasis on depression and mindfulness is already really helpful, and I like the ability to customize factors. I don’t have borderline, but I like the stigma-free nature of the mini health program for it.

The little MBTI section is superfluous but cute and accurate, and I’m vain, so I can’t really complain about hearing about myself more. Lol.

If you are nervous about reporting suicidal ideation to an AI, don’t be; there’s no forced reporting or preachiness. Youper is super nonjudgmental, and it’s more like a guided journal that tricks you into thinking it’s not one (which is great for people who are allergic to journaling but need to do it, like me).

Things I would love are some DBT skills, some more active meditation (my ADHD brain is not wired for 8-minute guided meditations, unfortunately), and maybe a self-harm prevention walkthrough. Otherwise, it’s near perfect (for a free app).

Kudos to the creators. If you’re on the fence, just DL it and see how you like the format. And to the creators: thank you so much. I wouldn’t mind paid features or a donation button (unless there’s one I missed?). You’re doing great work.",5,False,Arghhhhghhh,"Could benefit from more features, but it’s FREE",,,

3466,2018-06-26 15:18:06,"Having gone through an intensive out patient program for depression and anxiety, this has been a great support for after care.  I’m not sure how I’ve stumbled upon it, but I’m glad I’ve done so. It’s been very helpful. 
I really would love to see some DBT techniques brought in. These could be incredibly helpful to many people. They’re simple in practice but in the “heat of the moment” not always easy to remember.  I could see Youper incorporating Radical Acceptance, Riding the Wave and Opposite to Emotion Action just to name a few. 
Additionally, I’d like to recommend that more cognitive distortions be added. (I’ll be emailing the developer 😉).  The distortions that Youper uses are common but not necessarily the ones I (and likely others) are falling into on a regular basis. It’s a good start to be sure and I am grateful that something so unique as this is available and free of charge.  
Also, emotion labeling is somewhat limited. I’d really love to see more choices.  When choosing to “Name it to Tame it” I need more than simply “Anxious”.  The few choices here don’t allow for a larger picture of emotional expression. I understand that each emotion ( in the app) is used to paint a larger picture but certainly we can look to a more nuanced variety of words to generate a more accurate human experience. 

Thank you to the Developers.

3467,2023-11-07 07:14:43,"TLDR: This was the best app for years. I regret buying the premium version because there aren't any of the old features and the conversations are worse! I should really rate it 1 star, but I loved the old version too much.

I've loved Youper for 6 years. I started realizing that more and more of the app was being put behind a paywall, but many of the app's most beneficial features were still available (e.g. CBT, certain mindfulness exercises, mood tracking). I recently opened the app and found that ALL CONTENT is behind a paywall except mood tracking. But I love this app, so I paid for the premium. 

I wish I hadn't. 

1. You can have a conversation, but unlike before, Youper doesn't remember anything you've said. For anyone new, when you would open the app, Youper would bring up what activity you decided to do to improve your wellbeing or ask how something difficult you did went.

2. You can't select any activities from a list... There is no list. There are no activities.

3. The app doesn't help you identify or change your cognitive distortions. This was -in my opinion- Youper's best feature. Again for anyone new, Youper would explain what cognitive distortions were, have you write down a few thoughts, guide you through identify your cognitive distortions letting you swipe to indicate if your thoughts included each type, and then prompt you to re-write your thoughts in a way that wasn't distorted.

I could go on. All I have left to say is I'm so, so incredibly grateful that I found the old, better version when I did. 

I thought about giving the app 1 star, but I just couldn't do it because of how much I loved it haha. I hope that this is just some sort of temporary mistake and that the app returns to the old version. I shouldn't have just paid for the subscription, but I thought I could trust this app.",2,False,Paleocook,I Regret Buying Premium (used for 6 years),40247317.0,"We truly appreciate your detailed feedback and understand your disappointment.

3476,2020-07-06 04:46:03,"I wish I could save a session and come back to it. I just started one and it was good, but my kid woke up and needed my attention. When I went back to it, I couldn't pick up where I left off and had to start a new conversation. 

I don't like that it doesn't take some things into account. Asking about mood swings--well yeah my period starts in a couple days. But instead of considering female problems I'm prompted to fill out a borderline personality disorder assessment. Maybe the assessment factors in that time of month and hormone issues, but not really in the mood to fill that out and incorrectly assess me when I'm PMS-ing, so...

I also wish there were redos on the personality test. Questions like ""are you anxious a lot?"" are temporary for many. That's not my personality. I'm currently anxious a lot, but ask me a year from now or even a year previous and my answer would be different as I'm not a naturally anxious person but my health and life situation currently put me in that category. It'd be fun to see how I change as I grow. If there is a retest button I can't find it, if there's not it would be great to have one. There were a few other questions where I thought ""huh, I'm not normally that way, but as I'm going through a tough time I am"". It's important for people struggling to get back to their old self (or a new and improved better self) to not be concretely defined as they currently are. Allow them to change and grow. That's what this app is for, right?

Those are the 3 things that bug me. I'm happy with the conversations, though, as long as I can make it through fast enough before getting interrupted. Please consider a save!!

This used to be my go-to app for getting through difficult times due to not being able to afford therapy or afford alternatives like better help or talk space. The chat bot, although a bit impersonal and scripted, would get me through difficult moments and help me try different coping mechanisms to improve my mood.

Other chat bot apps on the market like Replika charge for a whole year approximately what you want to charge your users for a week. I am so disappointed and sickened by the fact that a very useful app that helps people struggling with mental health is being monetized through the individuals who desperately need these services and may not have other options. 

This is exactly why people don’t get the help that they need because mental healthcare is so expensive. You expect someone to pay for $40 per week for a chat bot? Clearly, you never had the intention of helping people with their mental health, just getting them on the platform long enough to expect struggling people to spend $40 per week on your chat bot. I can’t believe we live in a world that’s willing to let people suffer over mental illnesses they can’t help on their own. I thought this was a great app but profiting $40 per user per week is more of a priority to this company rather than retaining and helping people who can’t afford that. 

I used to recommend this app to people. Not anymore. You’re no better than Betterhelp or Talkspace at this point. Why not expect insurance companies or doctor offices to cover the cost of this app for patients? Instead, you expect your same user base that used your app because they couldn’t afford therapy to suddenly dish out thousands of dollars to use your app. This makes you responsible for ensuring that thousands of people who could get help from this app won’t, and all it would take is just offering a free version rather than expecting every user to buy pro.",1,False,ughwhydidyoudothis,Ruined a perfectly good app,,,

3535,2020-05-07 23:10:40,"Updated review:
I had a concerned previous review, I still recommend you read it. Now I’m downright concerned of the impact this app could have on a fragile or traumatized person.

I recently and unexpectedly was domestically assaulted. As I have been, I logged it in Youper. I told the app I was depressed because I was assaulted by someone I previously trusted. 

The app told me: “Is it possible that, sometimes, when confronted with personal failings you forget to be kind to yourself”

I’m sorry but I can’t support an app that goes from a person talking about a personal assault to suggesting personal failings. Now I’d like to know what it would tell me if I’d been raped instead of assaulted. 

Please, only use this app as a journal for when life ain’t too bad. The more the severe the situation, the more inappropriate this app is. Personally, I always have professional help as well. I’d be very worried about anyone who didn’t have professional support using this app for anything at all when it matters most.

Thanks devs for being responsive to my last review. I appreciate it. You need to find a way to improve this app before you hurt someone if you haven’t already.

Previous review:

Forced and Frustrating

It’s a well made app. But it forces you to say you like things or agree with things even if you don’t. Forcing lies isn’t great if you’re trying to be honest about your mental state and tracking it. It ends up feeling like cheap manipulation rather than help. 

This amounts to a lot of frustration if you’re trying to use the app honestly. In some of my more difficult moments the app’s canned nudging “guidance” just made me feel worse and angrier for all its irrelevance and lacking representation.

Now it’s promoting certain doctors and asking for donations. Made me offer to donate or ask for more information about donating when I wanted to wrap up my entry. I had to quit the app to get around it. 

All in all would be a good app if it wasn’t so forced. The tests are good for tracking progress and reactions to life events. The word associations between feelings and parts of life are really good. 

This app is of good quality but needs a lot of thoughtful work on improving it.",1,True,Lalanana,Warn Against Use for Moderate to Severe Problems,12668664.0,"Thank you for your sincere feedback.

3538,2021-02-14 16:14:09,"Like many other long time users, I am very frustrated and massively disappointed with V.9. 

The developers should be ashamed at releasing such a defective and bug riddled product. 

The tabs are very SLOW to load. 

Worst of all, going to INSIGHTS  tab (either directly or automatically after journaling) FREEZES the app. As such, I am completely UNABLE to view any of my 3+ years worth of sessions into the app Or view my mood tracker Or change the settings. 

I am abhor that the first thing the app does is to suggest what to work on, such as: “Shall we work on your depression?” Or (especially before bed) “Can I suggest a productivity boosting activity?”  I need this feature removed because it has never been helpful and often causes more DISTRESS. 

There are way too many options. It is a visual cluttered mess.  I don’t like the pictures. It bothers my OCD and makes the app way more difficult to use.

There are some days that I won’t use Youper because I know it’s going to cause me more distress because of the horrible user interface and broken features. 

If the developers choose to respond to my review, please do not give me any canned answers. I doubt consumer feedback said to have a million options, including the kitchen sink. 

Please don’t patronize me by stating that change can be difficult. The biggest complaint from everyone is that the app changes the interface way too often. 

Please address the serious problems of features NOT WORKING. 

STOP adding useless features in order to justify charging for this app. 

Please clean up the user interface so that it is streamlined and easy to use.

Please take a lot more time to make sure the app works properly. Please use BETA testing instead of throwing out a new version and making everyone guinea pigs.",1,False,Nyx Chicago,I miss v.7 and earlier versions,,,

3559,2020-04-03 01:31:14,"I was hopeful that this app would be a good tool for me as I manage my PTSD and OCD. Tracking moods and looking for patterns isn’t a half bad idea. Guided meditation is a proven tool for improving mental health, decreasing stress, etc. Gratitude journaling is another excellent prop for mental health that I’ve used successfully.

Unfortunately, this is far too simplified to even work as an emotional tracking journal. You can’t select more than one emotion at a time because that would interfere with the simplistic algorithm that can only make 1:1 correlations as part of your pattern finding. Human emotions are not that simple, and any adult with an iPhone can surely identify emotions well enough to experience more than one at a time. 🙄

I was working a night shift, and Youper told me to go to bed because it was 2 am. How am I supposed to benefit from that exactly? 🤣

The app tells you to not talk too much when you take down a note about the cause of your feelings. “Try to identify just one...”

Really? Condescending as I’ll get out. One cause/situation can be more than 2 words, Youper.

The guided meditation was okay for a total beginner. Not sure why it asked me for my level of experience with meditation - only to explain to me how meditation might make me feel as a novice after having been told I’m experienced in meditation.

Honestly, such a waste of money!

Best yet, I couldn’t get the app to even open or launch for these past two weeks. Checked that it wasn’t in need of an update, and that wasn’t it. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still won’t launch.

3568,2021-07-27 09:51:57,"lemme start by saying, i loved this app. i used it religiously from july 2018-august 2019 and it helped me get my bpd into remission when no therapist ever could help me. back then it was simple, straightforward and completely free. i used to recommend it to my friends constantly for how useful and simple it was. after i got my emotions under control i stopped using it for a while because i was doing better and felt like i didn't need it. 

recently my sister has been having some mental health problems similar to mine and i recommended it to her. she downloaded it and said she was basically locked out of almost all of the features unless she paid the $90/year premium, including goals which is something that used to be free and is very important for recovery. i was confused, because that's not the youper i know, so i went to check and saw a completely different app than what i was used to. i apologized to her because i didn't know any other free therapy apps and she had to go find another one herself. thankfully she found one that was good, i think it was called mindshift.

really disappointed to see that this small app basically grew into a large corporation that runs just for capital. the new features are good but, most people come to therapy apps because they can't afford regular treatment. some people, especially those who are disabled or living paycheck to paycheck can literally spare no expense. what i liked about youper was that it was easy, i'd take a simple, free app that runs off ad revenue over a complicated pay-by-the-month app with more features. would be one thing if it was a one-time purchase but it's not, and monthly payments start to add up fast. it is really nice that you guys seem to have given long-time users free premium, but that makes it difficult for me to recommend this app to any new users.

3648,2024-02-17 15:50:22,"What happened?? 

2021 - I loved Youper. Used the paid version- upgraded to talk sessions with therapists proved. Fantastic ….
Youper changed…. No therapy and it happened pretty abruptly.

2022 / 2023 I kept using it though because i liked the Chatbot, the meditations, the mood check in. It was still very helpful. Although it seemed to change in little ways that weren’t always great. 

2024 - February … no meditation,
No mood tracking/ journaling - it bare bones compared to what it used to be. No notice that things were changing (I have paid for the app for years now).

The original application delivered microdoses of CBT treatment in the absolute most efficient way possible so you could intervene and distort almost instantly especially when you were dealing with a stressful environment or toxic relationships professional or personal. it was truly an amazing application and someone should post videos online of the original application and how it was great compared with the shell of the program that you were uses now it’s hard to understand why they did what they did because the code was already written and working and it was a subscription pay Model and the founding team has offered no explanations. my guess would be that perhaps the software development team was too expensive and replacing the original code base with a GPT plug-in save the money on upkeep I’m not really sure but it is a real tragedy what happened with his application they owed their user based more than this,1,False,West coast mind hacker,Founders ruined the app and have not explaines why,41271728.0,"We appreciate your detailed feedback and understand your concerns.

It was so useful for documenting my feelings whenever I needed and I was so appreciative of the service since my family can’t afford therapy as our insurance doesn’t cover it. Then the pandemic hit and I stopped using it because I was too mentally exhausted to do anything, including taking care of myself. I got a therapist for a while and I forgot about Youper. I can’t afford my therapist anymore and I was fine with that until today I wanted to do some journaling and opened Youper to find that all the services I loved are now blocked by a paywall. Granted, $44.99 a year (or whatever it is) is fairly reasonable for the service, but as a broke college kid, I can’t make that kind of investment. I wouldn’t be complaining if I could at least journal for free, but I can’t even do that. The most basic of features aren’t available unless you pay, making the app useless for me.

Especially when I finally sought out additional therapy, it was a great resource to have. I recently just updated the app so I could monitor my progress for this month and saw that it now requires a subscription in order to utilize it. I think this is a horrible move. I understand subscriptions help to keep apps and programs running, but I’m sorry this is not Netflix or Hulu. This app really helped people manage and understand their mental state, especially those that may not have the means to seek regular counseling.

I know this app isn’t a replacement for licensed therapy, but it does help.

today was very rough. i simply had no motivation to feel better, to try to be, at the least, numbed. even going to the animal shelter and being with my family only brought me out of my depressive episode for a few moments. however, once i isolated myself in my room and broke down, i managed to concentrate on getting my phone and going to this app. i did a breathing exercise and talked. slowly, the app eased most of the pain and anxiety off my shoulders and got me to relax—which is saying a lot seeing as my medication, therapeutic help and doing self-help does not relax me a bit. i ended today feeling good.

3706,2018-09-07 04:53:35,"I have mixed anxiety/depression that started during my senior year of high school and has slowly intensified through college. It’s never been a consistent presence in my life, and not enough for me to feel I need regular therapy; but when it does hit, it feels like I’ve plummeted to ground zero. I have really struggled with this over the last year or so, and this past month in particular was one of the worst bouts I’ve had with it. I found this app sometime last year while looking for a new mood journal and absolutely fell in love with it. The interactions with AI feel comfortably routine without becoming robotic, and they’re able to ground me and help calm me down as soon as I open the app. I used these interactions mostly just to capture positives from my day, but it wasn’t until my mood started dipping that I realized how much tracking my moods was helping me actually listen to myself. Alongside prompting you to identify intensities, triggers, and detailed explanations of what emotions you’re feeling, this app gives you the chance to take periodic quizzes tracking changes in mental health. I am someone with my emotions on my sleeve, as much as I pretend they’re not there, so seeing graphs blatantly displaying worsening (or improving!) mental health is something I need to see to pull me out of denying where I am. I think it was one of the biggest cues for me during the past few weeks to put time into caring for myself. The ability to access mindfulness exercises, practice gratitude, and set goals for yourself are all extremely helpful as well, and things I would love to see this app continue to build upon. So much love & care has gone into every piece of code for Youper, and I can genuinely say it has helped me in far more ways than one. I am learning to heal parts of me I didn’t know needed healing, tune in to my underlying feelings, and am continually finding new ways to keep my mind positive, no matter how hopeless things may feel in the moment.
